* Add Hunger and Mood stats to add variety to the game
* Give the option to click on Shadow instead of only Sonic

* Give the option for different "habitats" - the PC box icons from Pokemon

	* Habitats should be buyable from the Chao Mart
		* Eventually have furniture and special things that can be bought to customize the chao's habitat
	* Each chao will have an environmental preference
		* Chao are happier when in their desired habitat, and sadder when they are not
	* Have the option for more than 1 chao per habitat

* Change mostly everything to jQuery asynchronous interaction
* Add a couple more custom evolutions for Special chao
	* These evolutions are currently as of yet undetermined at this time
* Eventually implement new colors of chao [WIP]

* Adoption Forest "deletes" chao that are in it once a month
	* Equivalent to the chao running away on the real game
