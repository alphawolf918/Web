(1, 'Adventures with Crappy Games I', 'Listen children and gather round, for I, solidbatman, have a story to tell. You see, I was once a big Call of Duty fan. The first 3 PS2 titles were fun and usually tougher than Medal of Honor, which was also a lot of fun for me. However, one fateful day, I bought Call of Duty World at War: Final Fronts. I was excited. I was pumped. I was ready to torch some poor Japanese soldier''s face off with a flamethrower. Sadly, it was not to be. I admit it, I made a mistake in buying a game. I know all of you thought me all knowing and powerful; I still am, but my pride was wounded by this game. You see, the flamethrower was a major let down because I ended up not killing anyone with it. Now that wouldn''t have been a huge issue had a certain bug not happened. That bug is technically called, "my squad mate thought he was a god and tried to walk through a tree but instead got stuck in said tree for eternity". I suppose in that case he is a tree god of some sorts. I did what any solider not played by Tom Hanks would do, I left him in his new found tree (I think a tree elf baking cookies joke should be inserted but no, I wont). I continued the level laying waste to my enemies and then IT happened. A door needed to be opened. Not a probelm, for I am solidbatman, a super solider that can open doo... oh wait. A squad member needs to do it? Ok, ummmm, wait. Isn''t he stuck in a tree at the beginning of the level? Oh crap... I should go get him. Well, I walked all the way back to the beginning of the level to my squad mates tree. Sure enough, the poor guy was still stuck in the tree, and not even all 3 of my grenades could get him unstuck. Maybe he was a tree god. Well, that was a fun hour I wasted. I took the game out of the disc tray in ager, placed it back in it''s sleeve in my Big Book of Games, and to this day, have not touched it. The moral of the story kids? Friends don''t let friends mess with trees. \r\n-Yours truly, solidbatman', '2012-10-06 03:40:37', 16);

(1, 'About Us', 1, 1, '  Â  Â  <em>##title##</em> is not just another gaming web site. We aim to not only bring in Minecraft players, but programmers and developers as well. The web site''s author, Paul, started designing web sites when he was thirteen. It is our goal to inspire other people to follow their own dreams, and to create their own ideas. DreamSpand was founded upon an idea: that everyone has a potential, waiting to be unlocked, and that by combining ideas and creativity from the minds of multiple people, greatness can be achieved. The web site started out as a general gaming web site, and after the course of a year, it rapidly transitioned into a Minecraft web site. It''s a game that keeps on growing, and it''s something that can be added on to. We believe it''s a great place for future game developers to start, and the game has real-life applications as well. The site was built from nothing; it was hand-coded and written by one person, not created by a web developer program. Mike created the original ProBoards forum simply called DreamSpand in 2011, and the idea expanded from there. The name was based off of an earler, ongoing forum that was semi-successful named DreamScape, which was also a gaming forum, but featured other aspects as well. After about a year and a half with little to no improvement or attention at all to the ProBoards forum, Paul''s original web site (The Ultimate Chao Garden) was discontinued by it''s host for funding issues. Rather than getting the site back, Paul forged an idea: since his last web site was built from the ground up (exactly like this one), why not do it again? He proposed the idea to Mike and after a month or so the plan was in motion. This version of the web site was originally released on June 6th, 2012, but its build date began on May 15th, 2012. There have been a lot of bumpy roads for the team, but both still believe in the general idea and goals of DreamSpand. The site is not just about bringing players together - it''s about bringing people together, with common interests and powerful concepts, that maybe they just need a bit of a push or motivation to get them started. The site also represents all of our Minecraft servers, and it is the hub for updates and news regarding them. If anything should ever happen to any of our servers as it has in the past, the players know where to go. We offer mods, plugins, schematics, world saves, servers, and in the very near future, we intend to provide resource packs and skins, as well. DreamSpand is home to player and developer alike, and we think that''s what gives it it''s driving force: the fact that the developers can build upon the ideas of the players, and that the players can directly or indirectly influence the developers. If we happen to start a few friendships and partnerships along the way, then well, that''s another goal achieved. DreamSpand is also unique in that it is a friendly-oriented web site. The staff aren''t cold and strict like a lot of site staff are; they''re warm and inviting, and they are more than willing to help the users and players with absolutely anything. If they need someone to talk to, we offer advice and comfort, not just as a healing force, but as a friend. We think it''s important to connect to our users on a level that brings us together, and unites different types of people with a common interest; we also understand, though, that this is not for everyone, and if the members wish to keep to themselves, we understand. The site was simply started with the idea of bringing together people and helping them cope with difficulties and the world around them, by allowing them into our virtual one, where they can build their own ideas. The first forum that Paul owned was called Chao Talk, and its main goal was to bring together people that had problems and struggles, and group them together to have them help each other in overcoming these issues. It was a very successful forum that lasted for eight years, and its motto was "You''re not just a member - you''re a friend." As the co-owner of DreamSpand Gaming, that''s one of the main things that Paul wishes to bring to the table: the feeling of connectivity and friendliness that''s so uncommon in today''s world. Mike also believes in this idea, and in simply starting friendships. We also believe in the concept of an idea: the fact that everything great starts with something small. DreamSpand Gaming wishes to be that starting place for people, that leverage that so many people are looking for, but rarely ever find. If we can push someone to achieve their goals and dreams, then we''ve succeeded in our mission. We''re not just a gaming web site, nor are we just a Minecraft site - we are a site of ideas, concepts, development, friendship and teamwork, and you never have to worry about the staff, or dealing with problematic users. The staff are very vigilent, and all of us wish to provide that feeling of home. We chose Minecraft not just because of its popularity, but because of the concepts we''ve learned from it: that when you provide a place for someone with nowhere to go, or for someone who''s looking for something, they''ll take shelther there; that if you build it, they will come.

(217, 'DreamSpand Rules [updated 3/22/13]', 'Hello, {display}, and welcome to DreamSpand Gaming''s forums. We want to ensure that you have the best time here that you can possibly have. This will require user interaction, and as such, we have to place a few regulations to try to keep the peace. Follow our rules and we will love you. Always.\n\n[center][size=5]SITE RULES[/size][/center]\n[section=1. Spamming]We hate the stuff, and we''d imagine you do too. As far as the food goes, well we don''t care either way, have at it. We just don''t want useless junk posted on here, or people coming by with those drive-by trollings. Most of all, we hate robots and can''t stand people that just post things for attention. This goes for comments and messages, too. Although users are able to block you in messages, you don''t need to do it in the first place.\n\nWhenever you start a new thread, the post itself must have at least 10 characters in it. That really isn''t asking too much, I don''t think. The submit button will be greyed out until this prerequisite is met.\n\nDon''t just spam around to get our forum medals, either. That''s an easy way to get token-banned, or to have your account disabled. Just don''t spam us and then we can be friends. Forever.\n[section=2. Flaming]This one should go without saying, but have respect for other people on the forum. DreamSpand is not interested in "wars" or anything of the sort. Healthy debating is one thing, but blatant disrespect will make us and others dislike you very much, very quickly.\n\nInstead of just starting an argument in the public, you can just click on the "Report" link directly below the user''s post. We are a friendly community, let''s keep it that way. Have a little decency, just a little bit, and try not to start any trouble. If trouble has already been started, don''t egg it on.\n[section=3. Advertising]Although we understand the need to get the word of your site out to everyone and everywhere possible, don''t just mooch off of our popularity. The web market is tough enough as it is! Once you''ve reached 100 posts, the "web site" field in your profile will show up and you can put it in there. We also accept it in your signature without any requirements, because trust us, we want to help you! There is even a forum achievement (also known as a site medal) for filling out your web site field. In short, we understand, but don''t take advantage of us, either.\n[section=4. Bumping]"Bumping" a post is updating the topic to be the most recent one on the list. This can be done by it being posted in again. Do not do this until someone else has posted in it. Don''t ask a staff member to do it for you, either. Just wait for someone else to post in it.\n[section=5. Authority]Never question a moderator (or a higher rank) about their decision or what they''ve asked you to do. If they ask you to calm down, cool it. There is a difference between keeping order and having an abuse of power. If you feel that there has been a problem, report them using the link at the bottom of their posts. The administrators will see it shortly thereafter and assess the situation.\n\nYou may not like them, but the mods and staff were picked by the admins and owners for a very good reason, and you better respect them for it. We don''t tolerate disrespect here.\n[section=6. Plagiarism]Not only is this a very idiotic move, it''s also unlawful. We will not tolerate any ounce of this. If you are trying to post something from another site, then paraphrase it and provide a source link to it. Although we would prefer you not steal anything from anywhere at all. But by no means should you take credit for something that isn''t yours, or that you didn''t do. We find these things out.\n[section=7. Begging]Don''t bug us about being staff. Asking us "cud i be staf plz" really doesn''t work. Just a little tip, there. And for the record, neither does "Could I be staff, please?" It''s up to the admins of the site to decide this for themselves, and asking them or anyone else will only make your chances even slimmer. You get to be staff by being a decent, loyal member for a good little while, not by puppy dog eyes and cheap scams.\n[section=8. Necromancy]If a topic is old, as in ridiculously old, don''t try to give it CPR. Trust us, it''s gone and resting peacefully. A couple of months is pushing it, but we won''t get you for that. But bring something back from the stone age, such as 4 months or so, and that''s just ridiculous. Instead of replying to the ancient, rotting topic, make another topic similar to it, and maybe include a link to the old topic in your new one. That way you have a reference to it and can kinda add on to it. \n\nHowever, ONLY post in it if you are ADDING value to it, such as new information or an actual, decent post. Those simple little posts just won''t cut it, so don''t do it.\n[section=9. Multiple Accounts]Having more than one account on the site is prohibited except for high staff and admins. We are the only ones that reserve the right to do this, as it is sometimes required. Though even they have to ask permission, first. If you need to sign your friend up or have a similar situation, don''t do it under the radar. We will find out and punish both accounts. So unless you want both you and your "friend''s" accounts terminated, talk to us about it first, by PM or by posting, doesn''t matter.\n[section=10. Excessive Swearing]We understand that the occasional swear word is gonna peer its head every now and again, and if you drop an F-Nuke, we get it. However, if you''re using it excessively, then we got a problem. Don''t be a sailor-mouth. That''s not who we are and that''s not who we want here.\n[section=10. No One Worded Responses]It just makes you (and us) look lazy. Put some effort into the posts, it will be considered spamming if it''s only a few words. There is a minimum word limit of 10 before you can post. Please adhere to it.\n[section=11. Cross-Posting]Don''t start multiple topics that have the same purpose. This will be counted as spam and treated as such.\n[section=12. Different Opinions]Just because someone has a different opinion than you, doesn''t mean they''re wrong. You will respect everyone else''s opinions and will not flame or disrespect them for it.\n[section=13. Safety Precautions]For your own, personal safety, we ask that you do not release any of your personal information on to the site. This could be dangerous.\n[section=14. Leave It To The Mods]Let the moderators and staff handle the out of control situations. Don''t be a God-Mod or try to step in to solve something that''s none of your business. It doesn''t get you turned into staff, it makes you annoying and it adds on to the problem. If you feel like you''ve been wronged, please use the Report This Post link found at the bottom right-hand corner of every post. Staff will be notified about it immediately.\n[section=15.

(141, '	Battlefield 3 Review [X360]', '[i]Single Player Campaign.[/i]\r\n\r\n-Visuals- 8.5/10\r\n\r\nThe graphics are good. Very good in fact.\r\nThe glare on your Holographic scopes, the bullets flying over your head, and the buildings you blow down all look fantastic.\r\nThe characters however, outside the cinematic, do not look as good as I think they could be. Your AI opponents all look alike, and that''s all equally bad. Their facial textures, including your own teams, simply look too plain.\r\nOther than the faces everything looks great, and the environment destructibility only adds to the magnificence.\r\n\r\n-Sound- 8.5/10\r\n\r\nNo complaints here. The guns all have their own unique sound, and the voice acting Is really good.\r\nI noticed that at times in heated situations the sounds could almost overwhelm you. A mix of full auto fire, heavy machine guns, tanks, and explosions all at once greatly helps immersion.\r\n\r\n-Gameplay- 9/10\r\n\r\nThe gameplay Is pretty much what you''d expect from an FPS. Guns, grenades and knifes. There''s little innovation here, but that''s not really a bad thing. Everyone from FPS veterans to newcomers shouldn''t have any problems getting used to the UI.\r\nI do however think that the distinct lack of customization, and vehicle access that you get in the Multiplayer really make the Single Player Campaign feel lacking. It does very little to prepare players for the stuff they''ll get into in the Multiplayer.\r\nThe vehicles you drive are limited to a Tank, and a passenger ride in a fighter jet. If you run out of ammo, or just want to switch things up, the weapons you can pick up from dead enemies all come with such varied set ups, It could be a big disadvantage for the player. A custom load-out for the SP Campaign would do wonders.\r\nAs would more vehicle interaction. If you finish the the SP Campaign, and decide to hop into MP right away you''re gonna find yourself very outgunned by enemies you were not really prepared for.\r\n\r\n-Story- 6/10.\r\n\r\nThe story is good. But that''s it.\r\nIt''s fairly dramatic, but It feels like much of the personal conflicts, and drama are being forced on the player, rather then simply being felt.\r\nBut I doubt this was written to be a good, solid story and more like a basic introduction into Multiplayer, which Is where most Battlefield players will be spending their time.\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n[i]Battlefield 3 Multiplayer Review.[/i]\r\n\r\n-Visuals- 8/10\r\n\r\nNot much has really changed from the Single Player, but I do get the distinct feeling that some minor graphics, such as glares have been down-toned, or just turned off.\r\nI could imagine this is because the MP section requires a bit more Processing power than the Xbox can manage, and having to spend more of it of barely noticeable details wouldn''t really make sense.\r\n\r\n-Sound- 8.5/10\r\n\r\nThe sounds are all the same, apart from the new voices for your characters.\r\n\r\n-Gameplay- 9/10\r\n\r\nGameplay remains the same, with a few additions.\r\nYou can spot/communicate with your teammates to help pilots take out big ground targets, or help your sniper take out enemies.\r\nRather the single soldier you play in the SP campaign, in Multiplayer you have 4 classes, Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon. Each with It''s very special weapons, and gadgets. And thanks to a massive variety in weapons, accessories, and gadgets you can play the game however you want to.\r\nSnipers for example do not have to rely on sniper rifles, and lying far behind the action. They can equip a shotgun, or a PDW and hit the front-lines using a small flying drone to help spot enemies for the rest of the team, or use a laser designator to help pilots and engineers take out enemy ground, or air vehicles.\r\nThere are a few balance issues with some weapons, for the moment I believe only a single shotgun is unbalanced, but expect that to be banned from most servers.\r\nAlso, I must criticize DICE/EA''s recent decision to remove all of their servers, and allow players to rent their own servers. Meaning every time you want to play a quick game, you are playing on another players server, and with his/her rules.\r\nThis really destroys large portions of gameplay for me, and many others since Admins are given full power over their servers, including banning whoever they feel like. I have been kicked, or banned at least a dozen times for reasons varying to needed space for friends/clan mates, to didn''t like that i had more points than the admin.\r\n\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n-Overall- 8/10\r\n\r\nA good, solid FPS. The Frostbite 2.0 Engine really comes together here, and everything is really well done. \r\nDespite some early balance issues in Multiplayer the game itself works great now, and It does require skills to win it. Good teamwork, and knowledge of how to best help your team Is what wins the wars.\r\nI do however think that the single player campaign should have trained the players better for the tasks they receive in multiplayer. Namely how to fly/drive. You will undoubtedly come across a new guy who''s never flown a helicopter before, and having a newbie flying simply spells disaster.\r\nThat said, I feel that at for the moment the only bad aspects of the game are at the fault of the players. The idea that players should be able to rent their own servers is great, I love the idea that clans could have servers for training, and tournaments, or just for friends to play together.\r\nBut the sad reality is that a lot of the servers players end up on play with distorted rules, sometimes caters exclusively to the Admin. And the ability to kick and ban whoever they see fit, and why they see fit Is a huge game breaker for me. I really don''t like getting kicked for reasons like letting friends in, or just because I''m "too good".\r\n\r\nIf the server/admin functions were to be revised I would definitely get far more enjoyment out of it, but as it is now, every time i get into a server I''m usually greeted by the admins welcoming message telling me what weapons I''m not allowed to use, or i end up on a Clans server, with 2-10 Clan members on the enemy team, all on voice chat. Guess who wins those matches.\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/58/Bf3-pc-cover.jpg[/img][/center]', 141, 9, '2012-06-26 09:36:19', 46, 'no', ':1:1:8:2:8:1:8:1:1:2:1:1:1:1:1:2:1:1:3:2:1:2:1:1:1:1:1:2:2:2:2:9:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:55', 'No Description', '2012-06-26 09:36:19', 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 68, '', '', 'no', '', '', ''),

All he can remember is his name, that he lives in Mayfair and that something is hunting him\r\n\r\n\r\n-Visuals- 6.5/10\r\n\r\nThe visuals are good, but not extraordinary. Good textures, models, and environment design, but visuals, and graphics are Not what this game delivers on.\r\nMost of the time you feel too scared, or involved with the story to notice the subtle graphics.\r\n\r\n-Sound- 8.5/10.\r\n\r\nOne of the first things that strike you Is the sounds. Not the music, not the ambiance, but the sounds.\r\nIn almost every room, and part of Brennenburg Castle new horrors can be heard from unseen places. You never let your guard down as a woman?s screams can be heard from the dungeons, or a babies cries echoes through the study halls.\r\n\r\n-Gameplay- 9/10.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay Is somewhat unique in the sense that your are, for all intents, and purposes defensless.\r\nYou cannot arm yourself against the horrors that hunts you relentlessly. Your only hope to survive is through cunning, and outsmarting the monsters who are always looking for you.\r\nThe game does not have a HUD, and you take hints about your health from on screen cues such as blurring, loss of control, and heavy breathing, and from the sound effects.\r\n\r\n-Story- 8.5/10.\r\n\r\nThe story Is what drives the game forward. In fact It is clearly stated that Amnesia should not be played to win, but to immerse yourself in the story.\r\nAs you go along you''ll constantly find notes, journal entires, and diaries to help you understand why you are In a foreign land, being hunted by an enemy you cannot see, and most importantly why you cannot remember anything.\r\n\r\n-Overall- 8.5/10\r\n\r\nProbably the best atmospheric game I''ve ever played. From the very beginning you never ever feel truly safe. The wind will blow doors open, and strange sounds will howl through the hallways.\r\nThe immersion Is simply amazing. You are left with only bits, and pieces of the storyline, and you will have to put the puzzle together yourself.\r\nAfter a while you do get used to the idea of hiding, and running a lot. And you learn the best ways to avoid the monsters hunting you. But even then you can never really know, where the next scare might come from.\r\nI admit I don''t scare easily. I might jump once In a while, such as with Doom 3 and the likes, but I don''t get scared senseless In these games often. After playing Amnesia I know that''s because in all other horror games you can at least defend yourself. In the hallways, and catacombs of Brennenburg Castle you cannot defend yourself at all.\r\nAfter getting scared one too many times I made a habit of barricading myself in "safe" rooms. Essentially rooms with one door, and I''d throw everything at It to block it. It added a small sense of security, but you still feel on edge.\r\nDefinately an amazing game well worth the time, and money.\r\n', 142, 9, '2012-06-26 09:51:09', 46, 'no', ':1:1:8:2:8:1:8:1:1:2:1:1:1:1:1:2:1:1:3:2:1:2:1:1:1:1:1:2:2:2:2:9:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:55', 'No Description', '2012-06-26 09:51:09', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 76, '', '', 'no', '', '', ''),

The world you can roam around Is quite large, and divided into 3 overall zones, these are, Northern zone with snowy mountain regions, and "modern" cities, with a few ranches, The Western zone with prairies and old fashioned western cities, and a Mexican zone south of the border with a revolution well under way.\r\n\r\n-Sound- 10/10\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack itself Is very well put together, and does It''s best to create the western atmosphere You''d expect. But the reason I''ve given the sound 10/10, Is 2 prominent sound effects. The classic pistol sound made famous by classic western movies I don''t even need to mention, and the possibly most famous Scream in movie history: The Wilhelm scream made famous in the Star Wars movies.\r\nWhile not crucial to the game in any way, It makes me feel good hearing such classic, and familiar sounds.\r\n\r\n-Gameplay- 9/10\r\n\r\nThe gameplay Is indeed very good, and solid, and easy to use. It''s not mind blowingly new, or original, but It works brilliantly nevertheless.\r\nThe shootouts are truly amazing, and a key feature Is the "Dead Eye" targeting system which slows down the fight in a Bullet Time manner, and allows you to place crucial shots to your enemies, and as the game progresses you can also paint your target with up to 22 points.\r\n\r\n-Story- 9/10\r\n\r\nThe story takes place in 1911, and 1914 respectively, and focuses on John Marston. A retired Outlaw trying to escape his violent past, and have a normal family life.\r\nAll the story missions in the game are indeed both clever, well written, and at times very amusing, and It is hard to stop playing once you get going. The story takes you all over the old West, and even across the border, and gives you a very good idea of what life might have been like in these times.\r\n\r\n-Overall- 10/10\r\n\r\nExcept for a few small visual glitches the game truly deserves all the 10''s, and 9''s critics worldwide have given it.

In the main game you got the sunny, old west kinda feel from the environment.\r\nIn Undead Nightmare the moon always glows in an spooky green, and the sky''s always look a bit darker than usual. It all adds up to create a truly magnificent horror environment.\r\n\r\n-Sound- 10/10\r\n\r\nThe best thing about the new sounds, and music in Undead Nightmare is that they are all basically the same as the main game, But warped to something completely different. The sounds accompany the scary environment in such a beautiful way It will send chills down your spine.\r\n\r\n-Gameplay- 9/10\r\n\r\nGameplay remains the same. There''s a few new things to do, like burning coffins, and saving zombie infested towns.\r\n\r\n\r\n-Story- 8/10\r\n\r\nBeing a big horror story fan I genuinely enjoyed the Undead Nightmare story from start to finish.\r\nThe only real thing i dislike Is the encounters you face with old acquaintances from the first game. While fun as they are, most of them do very little to advance the story, and are far too short lived to make a big impact on the player.\r\n\r\n-Overall- 9/10\r\n\r\nBy far one of the best expansions ever for a game. You are not restrained by a small area, or a set storyline. You are free to roam the haunted lands of the old west In a wonderfully scary, and weird environment where you can never truly feel safe.\r\n\r\nApart from the story, there are a lot of fun, new additions to the game including a Bigfoot encounter you might not see coming, 4 new weapons including a Blunderbuss, Holy Water, and Zombie bait, and lots more.\r\nAnd my personal favorite: The 4 Horses of the Apocalypse.\r\n4 unique horses you can find, and tame in the wild, War, Famine, Pestilence, And Death.

While the cinematics are truly amazing, some of the best I''ve seen in a while, some of the in game scenes sometimes doesn''t live up fully to the rest of the game. At times there are surfaces in the game who appears almost completely blank, which is kind of disappointing.\r\nAlthough most of the time the graphics will blow you away as you gaze into the fiery, cold, eternal depths of Hell.\r\n\r\n-Sound- 7/10\r\n\r\nThere wasn''t much of huge interest as far as sound goes. The music is indeed good, and really helps set the mood, but as with most Hack N'' Slash games the combat sounds gets very repetitive after a while.\r\n\r\n-Gameplay- 8/10\r\n\r\nThe overall gameplay is typical Hack N'' Slash with little innovation.\r\nAlthough this isn''t necessarily a bad thing it may get repetitive.\r\nDespite this there is still quite a few interesting aspects of combat that gives you a good thrill. You do wield the Scythe of Death himself, and that''s always something.\r\n\r\n-Story- 10/10\r\n\r\nThe story, which is loosely based of the original Dante Alighieri''s Divine Comedy, Is very good. It is a love story, and a tale of self exploration, and facing up to ones crimes. And It''s all put together very well, as you journey further into the depths of Hell, and you have to face all your sins, and defeat each one.\r\n\r\n-Overall- 7.5/10\r\n\r\nIt is a good game.

Now his wife, Alice, brings him to the idyllic small town of Bright Falls to recover his creative flow. When she vanishes without a trace, Wake finds himself trapped in a nightmare. Word by word, his latest work - a thriller he cannot even remember writing - is coming true before his eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n-Visuals- 9/10\r\n\r\nThe visuals of this game has been a subject of much discussion on several forums, and critics have all have different opinions on it.\r\nApart from very few small glitches, the two main topics were in short Screen Tearing, and the voice, and facial animations.\r\nWhile i myself expirinced very little, if any Screen Tearing, the facial animations were indeed a little off. I didn''t find it that upsetting, nor particularly annoying, but this is all up to the individual player to decide.\r\nOther than that the visuals were close to perfect. The scenery at times truly leaves you speechless.\r\n\r\n-Sound- 9/10\r\n\r\nThe sound effects of the game does a lot to help set the mood for the game. Both the ambient sounds of wildlife, and combat sounds are amazing, and they are really put to the test at times in the game when you encounter many enemies at once.\r\nAlong with the soundtrack, which is in the top 3 for greatest Game soundtracks for me at least, all the sounds you will hear come together to form one hell of an amazing gaming experience.\r\n\r\n-Gameplay- 9/10\r\n\r\nThe controls are very good. Although not 100% original, they really make you feel confident in playing, and rarely compromises your overall experience.\r\nThe combat Is quite interesting in that you literally have to use light as your weapon. This allows a small amount of strategic thinking to be done in order to survive tough encounters with multiple foes of different classes. Since you cannot simply fire off your weapon randomly and kill something you need to calculate your moves, and know when to run for cover.\r\nThe only Gameplay aspect i don''t like very much Is when driving a car. Theres no speeder adjustment as in most racer games, but only an On/Off setting for the gas, so you can''t drive along nice, and smooth, but rather bumpy.\r\n\r\n-Story- 10/10\r\n\r\nOf course a game about a writer needs a flawless, well executed storyline that leaves you wanting more.\r\nAlan Wake certainly delivers this. Theres cliffhangers, love stories, action packed bullet time moments, and much more.\r\nThe story in Alan Wake, along with the gameplay experience, It gives i find rather hard to explain in words, you almost need to play it for yourself, and let yourself be drawn into this mysterious action packed horror thriller.\r\n\r\n-Overall- 9.5/10\r\n\r\nThe only thing i find that drags the game down is the facial animation. While it doesn''t ruin the entire game altogether, It can be felt as not living up to It''s full potential.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Alan Wake is a fantastic story driven game with a truly amazing story thats hard to let go.\r\nI can only highly recommend this to all Xbox 360 owners.\r\n', 146, 9, '2012-06-26 09:53:57', 46, 'no', ':1:1:8:2:8:1:8:1:1:2:1:9:1:1:1:1:2:1:1:3:2:1:2:1:1:1:1:1:2:2:2:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:55', 'No Description', '2012-06-26 09:53:57', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 88, '', '', 'no', '', '', ''),

(155, '10 Things To Know About Sniping', 'We all have different shooting styles, and snipers are some of the best, as well as some of the most hated. This post will help you be less of a screw-up and more of a dead-on shooter.\r\n[section=10 Things To Know About Sniping]\r\n[b]1. Don''t shoot up close.[/b] Snipers are cool and very powerful, but up close they''re not too useful. NEVER go for the no-scope up-close, either. You may get it, but it usually winds up being your team-mate. Stand back at a distance far enough but not too far.\r\n[b]2. Aim for the head.[/b] As a sniper, headshots are your best friend. The more of them you make, the more accurate your shot will get and the more damage you will inflict. In fact, if you do it just right, it may be an instant kill. Sometimes it takes more than one shot, though.\r\n[b]3. Keep your eye on the cross-heir.[/b] Before you shoot at all, watch your cross-heir. Make sure it''s pointed at an enemy. In most games, it will light up red when pointed at an enemy. Don''t put your hand on the trigger until you''re ready to shoot. Otherwise you''ll misfire and may end up sniping yourself.\r\n[b]4. Watch your gun''s trajectory.[/b] Keep in mind that a sniper bullet can bounce very well. When you''re pointing it at something, make sure that, if it does bounce, it doesn''t come back and hit you or your teammate. That is never good.\r\n[b]5. Find cover.[/b] Make sure you''re behind something. At the very least, get close to something that you can get behind, should things turn bad. Remember that you''re not the only sniper out there. All it takes is one headshot and then BOOM you''re toast.\r\n[b]6. Sniping is a one-man job.[/b] If your other buddies like to snipe, don''t let them get too close to you. All it takes is one wrong move. You don''t want to get a betrayal and neither do they. Try to snipe from different locations. Just..not on opposite sides of each other, that will end badly.\r\n[b]7. Know who your team is.[/b] Don''t get overexcited and start shooting anything that moves or breathes. If someone on your team dies, don''t go teabag them. That really is about as low as you can go. This isn''t really a sniper-specific thing to know, but I thought I''d mention it.\r\n[b]8. Don''t get trigger happy.[/b] Sniper shots need to be fired precisely and accurately, not rapidly and carelessly. The gun is like a woman. It''s all how you hold her.\r\n[b]9. Don''t waste any shots.[/b] Unfortunately, in most games, the sniper rifle has a very limited amount of ammo. Before you fire, make sure it''s not a wasted shot. And don''t just shoot to shoot. It doesn''t make you look cool.\r\n[b]10. Target practice.[/b] Find a way to train yourself to shoot targets better. Moving and still alike. There is always room for improvement. The more you practice, the better you will be.\r\n\r\nI hope this post has helped you.

(162, 'Ghostbusters: The Video Game Review [X360]', 'The events of the game begin during Thanksgiving Day 1991, two years after the events of Ghostbusters II. The Ghostbusters, now official city contractors, are training a new recruit, whom Dr. Venkman insists they simply call "Rookie", so they don''t get too attached, in case something should happen to the new hire while testing out experimental equipment. A large PKE shockwave then hits New York City, and sends the team on a variety of calls to capture ghosts that result from it, including Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.\n\n\n\n\n\n-Visuals- 9/10\n\nThe visuals all around really improves the game experience. The locations are very well designed, and thought out.\nNotably a Library, and a laundromat you pass through are scripted to near perfection and really gives you the feeling you are actually looking for ghosts in very haunted locations.\nA very notable example of the high level graphics is the Sedgewick Hotel on which you go around exploring a floor of the hotel on your own. After some time looking for a Ghost the hotel drastically changes design from a fancy uptown New York hotel to a rotten watery grave of sorts. Water flushes through the halls, and corals grow on every wall.\nVery well executed.\n\n-Sound- 7/10\n\nThe music is alright. Of course a lot of tunes from the movies re-appear here, but after a while It tends to get repetitive.\nThe sound effects are spot on, from firing your Proton Pack, to tossing traps at ghosts.\nAmazingly just about every single character from the movies appear in the game, And their original actor also does their voices which is very rare to find in such games.\n\n-Gameplay- 8/10\n\nGameplay is fairly simple. There''s no detailed combo''s, or puzzles to complete that requires tons of training.\nThe game switches regularly between hands on frontline combat, and ghost hunting, to quite down investigation.\nYou''ll wander the deserted building, and halls of New York alone, and look for clues as to where the Ghost is hiding, and how to most effectively take him down.\nThe game isn''t nearly as repetitive as one would think. There''s plenty of chances on every level to use every single piece of equipment at your disposal.\n\n-Story- 9/10\n\nThe story is co-written by Dan Akroyd, and Harold Ramis, which is a quality stamp in itself.\nThe story follows the Mythology from Ghostbuster''s II, with a lot of references to the first movie as well.\nThere''s really nothing wrong with the story, all the actors does a great job with their characters, and the story is very well executed all along.\nFor me the only issues were narrowed down to 2 points, 1: At some points after finished a level the game quickly switches location without any given explanation as to how the team got there. For example, after finish one level where the last scene is from the Sedgewick Hotel, the very next scene shows the team on a boat without any details regarding their transport given. 2: The player character simply named ?Rookie? is a very silent Protagonist. Similar to Master Chief from the ?Halo? franchise who rarely speaks.\nThe ?Rookie? character however doesn''t speak at all. Which really doesn''t work for a game like this. The prime example is a scene where the Player is separated from the rest of the Ghostbusters in a, lets say, dramatic fashion. Rather than communicating with the others the player merely shakes his fist angry at the sky. It''s kills some of the mood when the player feels like something should be spoken out loud.\n\n-Overall- 8/10\n\nA good solid game without question. It is not completely wrong to call this the ?Third Movie? given that all the original actors are in it, and the story follows so closely to the original movies.\nThe story does however fall through on a few points that dulls down the game at some points.\n', 162, 9, '2012-06-27 15:02:44', 46, 'no', ':1:1:8:2:8:1:8:1:1:2:1:9:1:1:1:1:2:1:1:3:2:1:2:1:1:1:1:1:2:2:2:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:55', 'No Description', '2012-06-27 18:03:28', 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 67, '', '', 'no', '', '[Quick-Edit]', ''),

That one word describes the first word I think of to describe Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Everything is yellow. I''m not sure what that adds, but it fits. Yellow sets the mood of the game; a dark brooding world that seems on the verge of collapse. The environment of the game is very well done and I felt immersed in the world of 2027 Deus Ex. There is a stark contrast between the have''s, and the have not''s in the story and the visuals compliment that perfectly from clothing to the way people in the game carry themselves. \r\n\r\nThe cutscenes look okay for the most part. Backgrounds and setting look incredible but where the visuals fail to impress me is the actual characters. They look stiff and move awkwardly. This is most evident during the cutscenes when static objects look incredible, but anything that moves falls a bit short. I also noticed my framerate dropping throughout the game and a few graphical glitches, such as sliding enemies, and towards the end of the game, a civilian disappearing then re- appearing in the same spot. These glitches, as well as the character animation lower what could have been a very high score.\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://www.el33tonline.com/images/cache/12740.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://godtiergaming.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/deus-ex-human-revolution-9.jpg?w=490&h=275[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n-Sound- 8/10\r\n\r\nPeople may disagree with me on this one, but I found Adam Jensen''s voice to be irritating. While emotion was showed at times, I thought the sandpaper voice was not the best of ideas. I can''t complain about anyone else though. All in all, the voice acting was good. The soundtrack is amazing and one I love to listen to. The music sets the mood as the color scheme does. I felt like i was a part the the world I was playing in.\r\n\r\n-Gameplay- 9.7/10\r\n\r\nAny fan of the Metal Gear Solid Series will feel right at home here. At heart, Human Revolution is a stealth action game. Silent take downs of opponents are easy to do, and hiding from guards is usually as simple as hiding in a vent of behind a box. Certain augmentations (more on those in a minute) even show you a guards cone of vision on your mini map.  Adam Jensen can''t take very many bullets before going down, so entering in any sort of fire fight is a big risk. Sneaking up on a guard, or even avoiding them all together will net you more experience and you will stay alive longer. \r\n\r\nAugmentations are what really make playing this game different every time. By completing missions, being stealthy, hacking, exploring, and having successful interactions with various characters give you experience points. Gain enough of these, and you receive a Praxis point, which allows you to level up an augmentation (It takes two Praxis points to unlock a new augmentation). If you need a certain augmentation right then and there and can''t wait to level up, for a fee, you can buy a Praxis point. There are many different routes to take when picking augmentations. If you enjoy being stealthy, then invisibility, or silent running are for you, but if you enjoy firefights, then extra armor is what you would pick. There are plenty to pick from, and unless you play the game to death, it will be very difficult to unlock every augment. Depending on which augmentations you pick, the game will be easier or harder with certain play styles.\r\n\r\nThe city hubs, the main locales of the games, are all large enough to not feel repetitive, but small enough to be easy to navigate and find your way around. Throughout the city hubs are various NPC''s that will ask for you for your help. Denying these missions will not hurt you in anyway other than missing out on some experience points. \r\n\r\nI found that I could attack civilians and wait for the subsequent alert to run it''s course then walk past the same civilians as if nothing happened. It felt kind of silly, but other than that, I think that Eidos Montreal did an incredible job crafting the gameplay of Human Revolution. The story is linear, but how much you see of the story outside of the main points is up to you. Hacking every computer you come across (like I did) will show you a little bit extra of the story, not to mention allow you to find some funny emails. \r\n\r\n-Story- 9/10\r\nThink you have it figured out? Guess again, there is a conspiracy. That''s the overall impression of the story I got. No one is ever honest and no one is helping you for your benefit only. Anyway, the game opens with you getting shot in the face and your ex getting kidnapped after an attack on Sarif Industries, for whom you are the security chief. Sarif Industries keeps Adam Jensen (you) alive by performing augmentation surgery on you. Now augmented, Jensen is ordered to find the people that attacked Sarif Industries. I thought the story was somewhat muddled, but still enjoyable. The side missions add a lot to the story and character development, so don''t ignore them.\r\n\r\n-Overall- 9.5/10\r\n The incredible gameplay offsets most of the other issues I had with this game. The sheer amount of customizations you can do with the augmentations is awesome, and unlike some games, it actually does change the way you play the game. I wish some of the character movement wasn''t so stiff and that certain voice actors sound better.

I wasn''t all that active(I had my own forum to look after!), but I made many great friends.\r\n\r\nI mostly hung around the Xat chat that CT had. Most people did, actually, and the forum itself started to die out a little. XL sent out a few newsletters trying to get the site up and running. I came back to the forum and made some posts, only to fade back to the chat in a couple of days. Bad Kapus!\r\n\r\nXL then made a new site. DreamScape, I think it was called? He sent out a Chao Talk newsletter about it. I registered there and introduced myself only to forget about the site a week later. Bad Kapus!\r\n\r\nToday I got yet another newsletter from Chao Talk, this time talking about a site called DreamSpand. No, not DreamScape. DreamSpand. I felt pretty bad for leaving CT and DreamScape to rot, and I really miss the CT guys, so I decided to come around. The aforementioned CT chat died along with CT so I really don''t see my friends too often. I was hoping to see them here, but I don''t recognize anyone aside from XL.

(346, 'Vanquish (PS3 Review)', '[center][img]http://wirelessmedia.ign.com/wireless/image/object/142/14231560/Vanquish_PS3_US_M-logoboxart_160w.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n-Visuals-[b] 9.4/10[/b]\r\nLike everything about this game, the visuals are over the top. Unlike a lot of shooters, there seems to be no limit to the number of enemies that can appear on screen at once, and the game handles this very well with absolutely no slowdown what so ever. The suit that Sam, our main character, wears is impressive looking and the blur effects of his rocket slide are great. The game takes place on a giant space colony orbiting Earth and the developers did a great job making the environment fit the setting.\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://www.buzzfocus.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/vanquish3.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1046/4728031549_2e6885bffa.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n-Sound- [b]8.5/10[/b]\r\nThe music featured is a techno soundtrack, which fits the setting of the game and adds to the environment. The voice acting, while not incredible, is decent enough and does convey proper emotion. The sound effects are loud, loud loud. With bullets flying around, things blowing up around you, and your fellow soldiers dying around you, it can sound pretty hectic.\r\n\r\n-Gameplay- [b]9/10[/b]\r\nVanquish is a fast paced stylized third person shooter. Pretty much, nothing is worth doing, unless you can make it look awesome. To make this happen, Sam is equipped with a suit called an Augmented Reaction Suit. This suit, developed by DARPA, essentially turns you into a walking tank. Unlike a tank, though, you can move extremely quickly utilizing a rocket glide that allows you to slide along the ground at a very fast speed. The suit will overheat if you slide for too long though and it must cool down. When this happens, you will be a lot less mobile. The game forces you to slide from one point of cover to another point of cover to avoid taking damage. \r\n\r\nIf at any point you take too much damage, you will enter Augmented Reality mode, which slows down time and allows you to find cover. Upon exiting AR mode, your suit will need a cooling off period, just like using the rocket slide for too long. You can also manually turn AR mode on to help you clear out a group of enemies if there is little cover, or to get behind larger enemies to get their weak spot. Boss battles are a huge part of Vanquish. I say huge because the bosses are just that. They are just massive. Of course, the boss battles are as simple as finding the weak point of the boss, and laying waste to it. \r\n\r\nVanquish scores everything that you do as well. Like many arcade shooters, you get points for completing the level quickly, killing and blowing up plenty enemies, and making it all look good. Naturally, you lose points for allowing team members to die, dying yourself, and you lose a time bonus for taking too long. One of my only complaints about this game is the length. I finished the game in just under 4 hours. It was a fun 4 hours, but i wished it could have lasted longer.\r\n\r\n-Story- [b]7/10[/b]\r\nNot much of a story, but to sum it up, the United States government is at war with Russian extremist that have taken over the Russian government. The US had launched a space colony to use sunlight as an alternative fuel source, but the Russians end up taking it over and turning it into a weapon to destroy San Fransisco and call for the immediate surrender of the US or have New York City destroyed. The US president instead sends marines, under the command of  decorated war hero Robert Burns, to the colony to take the colony back. Sam Gideon, out main character is also given a secret objective; rescue Dr. Francois Candide who is working on the colony and is trying to disable the colony. There is very little character development and I felt a lack of connection to the story.\r\n\r\n-Overall- [b]8.3/10[/b]\r\nThe best way to describe this game is style over substance. It looks and plays great but lacks a good story and character depth. It also is very short and doesn''t have much in the way of replay value. It''s a fun game and a great way to kill a few hours if you''re bored.\r\n', 346, 16, '2012-07-16 14:14:12', 46, 'no', ':16:9:1:2:2:1:1:1:1:1:2:1:1:3:2:1:2:1:1:1:1:1:2:2:2:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:55', 'Spoiler Free', '2012-07-16 14:14:12', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 101, '', '', 'no', '', '', ''),

Problem is, though, that the engine has aged, considerably. Rocks still look plastic, there is still little character interaction with the ground, and the frame rate is very choppy. Don''t get me started on the freezes I suffered, including one that forced me to replay a solid hour of the game. But since I''m an optimist, I can find some good things about the visuals. NPC facial animations look much more natural and while the rocks and ground still look unnatural, the buildings and draw distance are much improved. The Vegas Strip was a bit underwhelming even with all the lights. It just lacked character. It didn''t feel like Vegas, it felt like an out or place street that has become a military furlough hot spot. The rest of the waste land certainly feels like a brighter version of the Capital Wasteland, just brighter. The Fallout series has always been about creating a believable 1950''s post- apocalyptic world, and Obsidian gets the job done here.\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://www.ps3attitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/fallout_new_vegas_screenshot_1.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://bulk2.destructoid.com/ul/172756-Robot-620x.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n-Sound- 8/10\r\n\r\nThe voice acting is fine, the music is fine, if not unnoticeable. The voice acting did see an improvement. There is a lot more diversity in the voice acting. Rather than every old guy sounding the same, some old guys have deep voices, other higher pitched voices. This goes across the board.  \r\n\r\n-Game play- 9.8/10\r\n\r\nBetter than Fallout 3''s game play in nearly every sense. There are more quests, more endings, more weapons, more locations, and more factions. The Karma system is back, but the new reputation system judges how people will react to you instead. Completing certain missions for one faction will make your reputation with that faction better, but it may hurt your reputation with another faction. Gambling in the Strip is another new feature, one that I cared little for. Maybe others with a love for card games will enjoy the casinos.\r\n\r\nWeapon mods can now be purchased in New Vegas. These include a larger clip, scopes, and more. Weapons also have more than one type of ammo that can be used. Armor piercing shells, hollow tip shells, and buckshot shells are just a few of the many types of weapons. Workbenches are back as well and now, used up ammo can be recycled if you are short on caps, or you can break down ammo for unused guns and create ammo for guns that you do use. Item creation is another new aspect to New Vegas. With the right ingredients, perks and recipes, you can even create your own stimpacks. \r\n\r\nThe V.A.T.S system is back. This allows you to stop time and aim at specific body parts of your enemy (or friend if you''re like that). Oh, I shouldn''t forget to mention the collectible snow globes. If you enjoyed bobble head collecting in F3, then you should enjoy snow globe collecting. The only difference is that snow globes do not give you any perks, but some one in New Vegas pays a huge sum of caps for them (I''m serious, it''s a lot of caps). All of your favorite perks are backs from F3 as well as some new perks. A perk, for those new to the series, is a bonus you receive after reaching a certain level. There are plenty of perks, all of them given creative names and a nice bonus to go along with it.\r\n\r\n-Story- 9.8/10\r\n\r\nGoing with the theme of more, Obsidian created a story with over twice as many outcomes as Fallout 3. The game opens with you coming down with a serious case of bullet to the head thanks to some thugs out of the New Vegas Strip. They take your package that you were to deliver to the town of Primm. As chance would have it, a Securitron named Victor saves your life and takes you to a doctor in the tiny town of Goodsprings. You embark on a quest to find the men that left you for dead. The story seemed simple at first but quickly became a deep complex story. You end up having to take a side in the upcoming Battle of the Hoover Dam, which supplies power to the Mojave Wasteland. I really enjoyed the story due to the fact that I was essentially writing it. There are so many possibilities in completing any given missions. No two games will be the same.\r\n\r\n-Overall- 9/10\r\n\r\nAt no time did I feel like I was playing an expansion to Fallout 3. The environments, game play, and story add together to make a great game. Aside from the few graphical hiccups, I had no problems with this game.', 434, 16, '2012-08-06 23:17:46', 46, 'no', ':16:9:1:2:1:1:3:34:2:1:2:1:1:1:1:1:2:2:2:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:55', 'The best review you will ever read or your money back.', '2012-08-06 23:17:46', 0, 0, 0, 0, 16, 88, '', '', 'no', '', '', ''),

(431, 'Top 10 PS2 (or Xbox/Gamecube) Games', 'I know the PS2 is an old system (just saying that makes me feel old), but that doesn''t mean that the games don''t hold up to todays games. In fact, in many ways, I think many PS2 games surpass the games of today. But thats a discussion for another thread. Instead I want to list my top PS2 games. So here we go. And don''t worry, a more relevant list of my top PS3 games is coming along soon.\r\n\r\nHonorable Mention- Gran Turismo 4\r\nMy friends called me crazy; told me I couldn''t do it. I proved them wrong. I completed the 24 hour race. Just three to go. Oh, the rest of the game is pretty awesome too. Great visuals, nice sound track, realistic driving, and challenging races. Just a great game overall.\r\n\r\nHonorable Mention- Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty\r\nSo what if the story doesn''t make sense, or the main character is a very girly man, or Snake is next to useless, the game is still fun. Anyway, stuffing people into lockers and waiting for their friends to open them is always entertaining.\r\n\r\n10. Xenosaga Episode III\r\nThe epic saga concludes. It ends too quickly, but it still explains many of the Xenosaga universe''s mystery''s. An ending 400 years in the making. It''s not the #1 because it''s not the best game ever, but it is the most fun game I''ve ever played.\r\n\r\n9. Xenosaga Episode I\r\nIt''s so confusing, it works. Not for the meek or weak as this game tests your brains and endurance.\r\n\r\n8. Rogue Galaxy\r\nIt''s nice to play an RPG that doesn''t blow your brains out with a crazy complex story or stress you out for being too difficult. Rogue Galaxy is an easy to learn game with a low degree of difficulty. It''s not too easy, but after games like Personas 3 and 4 and the Xenosagas, it''s nice to play a relaxing and fun RPG.\r\n\r\n7. Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal\r\nGive a Lombax a gun and this is what happens. An evil robot tries to turn all the "squishies", aka anything living, into robots. Add in a memorable cast, plenty more guns, and incredible action- platforming game play and you''ve got yourself an extremely enjoyable game. It''s so good, I''ve beaten 5 times now. Seriously! \r\n\r\n6. Star Ocean: Till the End of Time\r\nAn incredible RPG. A wonderful story, engaging characters, item creation, and a crazy cool battle system; this game is a gem. If you haven''t heard of it, well you must not be cool (like I am).\r\n\r\n5. Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence\r\nEverything that was wrong with Snake Eater has been fixed. Better camera system, more camo options, extra missions, and cut scene theaters, this edition is the one to buy, if you can find it that is.\r\n\r\n4. Resident Evil 4\r\nResident Evil 4 fixes Resident Evil. Crappy controls? Fixed. Stupid save ribbons? Fixed. Scary? Ok, maybe this game is more action than horror, but being chased by a chain saw wielding zombie does get your heart pumping.\r\n\r\n3.  Shin Magami Tensei Persona 4\r\nA stunning and quite funny game with a good story to boot. While it isn''t as good as it''s older brother (P3F, I liked the story much better) it still is better than many games I''ve played. Chie''s kung fu and Teddie''s, well, just Teddie in general adds to the majesty of this thrilling mystery.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Shin Magami Tensei Persona 3: FES\r\nOne of the few games I want to play again. The story was amazing, game play was even better, and level grinding has never been more fun. Don''t forget to make friends and fuse Personas. A great RPG/High school Sim.\r\n\r\n1. Final Fantasy X\r\nThis game holds the record as the only game to make me tear up when I finished. The story has so many twists and turns, the battle system is easy to learn, Blitzball is the second greatest thing ever (sliced bread is #1), and plenty of humor thrown in (Lulu is a downer though). It took some heavy thought to decide between FFX and Persona 3, but in the end, FFX''s more upbeat story took the title as my top PS2 game.', 431, 16, '2012-08-06 14:37:18', 46, 'no', ':16:9:1:1:2:1:1:15:3:1:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:2:2:2:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:2:1:1:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:55', '', '2012-08-06 14:37:18', 0, 0, 0, 0, 16, 125, '', '', 'no', '', '', ''),

We don''t hand positions out willy nilly; we monitor a user for a long time and decide if they could help us. With the site still in its beginning stages, there''s a lot that still needs to be improved. Most of the work I do, the main part actually, is work on the files and images of the site. There''s a good 300+ something of them that I edit and add on to every week. Needless to say, I do need assistance. Thankfully I don''t run this site alone, as Mike is the co-owner and original founder of the first DreamSpand site on ProBoards; this domain name was built originally as an extension and (as intended) it became the home site.\r\n\r\nThere are rules here to regulate the community, and they''re mostly things that you''d expect from pretty much any forum, it''s mostly just basic stuff. However, it doesn''t stop there. Due to past allegations with my previous, popular communities, I felt we needed to set some staff rules too. This way, we keep a steady, well-paced community without any doubts or second thoughts.\r\n[size=8] -- Staff Rules -- [/size]\r\n\r\n1. First and foremost, no half-devotion. What I mean by that is, don''t be a part of the staff if you''re just going to complain about the site. We get enough of that from regular members and that''s who we''ll listen to. We have no problem demoting you if you have a problem with something.\r\n\r\n2. We work as a [b]TEAM[/b]. The admins will do a lot of work, but that doesn''t mean we should have to do all of it, so long as we have a full staff. In other words, if we need stuff for the site, and you have skills in what we need, the least you can do is offer suggestions or ideas. Teams don''t stand against each other. Nor do they stab each other in the back.\r\n\r\n3. Don''t be what I call a spy-staff. Basically what that is, is someone who is on the staff just to mooch information off of us to spew somewhere else, such as a rival site or even just regular members, before we give the approval for it to be out. The instant you leak something, you''re fired. No questions asked at all.\r\n\r\n4. This one really should go without saying, but believe it or not we actually had people stupid enough to do this. No backstabbing the site staff or going against the admins. If all you do is fuss and fight us, we don''t want you here as a regular member, let alone a staff member. If you think that someone may be "power hungry" or if you just don''t like someone in general, you''re not fit for the job and then you''re done. This is what children do, and we don''t have time for it.\r\n\r\n5. When we call being a staff member "a job," it does [b]NOT[/b] mean at ALL that you will get paid actual money. Perhaps tokens every Friday or something, I have yet to put that in but other than that, you''re basically an intern.\r\n\r\n6. Even though you''re staff, it doesn''t grant you permission to start breaking the regular rules. Like everyone else, me included, we also have to follow them. Staff lead by EXAMPLE. Set a good one.\r\n\r\n7. If you''re just too busy or have too much going on, don''t sweat it. It doesn''t mean we''re going to demote you, so you don''t have to panic. Your life comes FIRST. At the end of the day, this is just a site, and it''s not an obligation by any means. As long as you help out every so often and are relatively active (as much as possible, anyway), you''re good. This one really isn''t so much a rule, it''s just I''ve seen people stress out even more over this stuff when they don''t need to. It''s okay.\r\n\r\n8. Don''t be a grammar cop. I had someone at my last community that would instantly correct a member and call them an idiot or stupid if they misspelled a single word, even if just by one letter. You''re smart enough to tell what it says, so don''t be a jerk about it. There''s nicer ways of asking than just correcting someone like a snob.\r\n\r\n9. We''re going to have Community Game Nights. During this time of communication (through headsets or whatever), you should still follow the rules. Play fair, no cheat codes or any crap like that. And don''t be a rage quitter.\r\n\r\n10. Have fun. The rules really aren''t as tight as they seem, they just have to look that way so no one crosses the line. I don''t want to, but I will very quickly make an example of someone if I have to. All in all, just don''t get snobby or tightened up. This is a fun place about gaming, so let''s keep it that way! :)\r\n\r\nThank you for reading.\r\n\r\n-- Alpha', 482, 1, '2012-08-23 19:41:38', 46, 'no', ':1:9:2:3:16:1:2:1:1:1:1:1:2:2:2:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:55', 'Yes, you have rules too.', '2012-08-23 19:41:38', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 39, '', '', 'no', '', '', ''),

The guys over at Visceral did a great job with the atmosphere on the USG Ishimura in Dead Space and again, they deliver with an absolutely creepy enviroment with the Sprawl. The Sprawl, being a giant facility off one of Saturn''s moons, is also a lot larger than the USG Ishimura allowing the developers a lot more freedom in the designs. Only once, maybe twice, was there any sort of back tracking in Dead Space 2, unlike the original where back tracking was common. The graphics have improved, a lot. Things just look crisper and real, though facial animations are a bit stiff, not that there are many to see. All in all, these may be some of the best graphics I have seen in a game.\r\n\r\n[center][IMG]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/solidbatman/9197.jpg[/IMG][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][IMG]http://www.thezombienation.com/blogpicts/Dead-space-Screenshot-2.jpg[/IMG][/center]\r\n\r\n[u]-Sound-[/u] [b]9.8/10[/b]\r\nLet''s address the biggest thing in sound first, the voice acting. The voice acting in Dead Space 2 is perfect, and I mean it. From Ellie, to Stross, and especially Issac, every main cast member delivers his/her lines perfectly. Oh and yeah, Issac talks in Dead Space 2. No more stomping grunts or pain induced yelling, Issac is now a fully fleshed out character and we know what he is feeling, because he tells us. Don''t think he''s gone and suddenly become a chatterbox. The writers gave him the lines he needed and the voice actor delivered them with perfection. My only complaint is in some of the recordings scattered through out the ship. The voice work is not quite perfect and most are fine. One or two, though, just didn''t wow me like the rest. The music is scored perfectly, building suspense and fear while being very non- intrusive. Sound effects? Yeah, they will scare you. Walking through that nursery in the Sprawl is something I hope I never have to do.\r\n\r\n[u]-Gameplay-[/u][b] 9.5/10-[/b]\r\nDead Space 2 is about as streamlined as they come in terms of game play. Visceral Games stuck with the over the shoulder camera and once again it works. It makes the player feel more vulnerable and on edge. From the very beginning of the game, you are made to feel helpless, and Visceral does this by placing you in a straight jacket and necomorphs all around you. It does get better as you finally get weapons and armor, but ammo is scarce, and health packs can be hard to come by. Dead Space 2 features a better zero gravity system, more weapons, and more armor that grant you certain bonuses at times. You can upgrade your suit and weapons at a work bench if you have power nodes to do so. The stasis and kenesis powers that Issac''s rig has come into play a lot more in this game than they did in the first game. I found myself constantly hurling the severed arms of necomorphs at other necomorphs as they attacked me. The only thing I felt was off with gameplay was the fetching. I felt like, especially in the middle of the game, that all I was doing was fetching things and I wasn''t really getting anywhere, but the last half of the game really picks up the pacing and things move quickly from there.\r\n\r\n-[u]Story[/u]- [b]9/10[/b]\r\n Dead Space 2, as I said before, takes place on Titan, one of Saturn''s moons, in a densely populated metro called the Sprawl. Issac wakes up in the Sprawl wearing a straight jacket and having no recollection of the past 3 years. In order to not spoil any of the first game, I won''t tell anymore, but trust me when I say, the story is as good as they come. The only downside, is that things can get muddled and confusing if you don''t pay attention, and even if you do, it can take some thought to figure out.\r\n\r\n-[u]Overall-[/u] [b]9.7/10-[/b]\r\nI had a ton of fun playing Dead Space 2, and I will end up playing it again soon. Very few games make me want to platinum, but this game has won me over and I will end up at least trying to platinum it. That of course means playing through on hardcore mode, which is unlocked after beating the game. In hardcore mode, there is little to no ammo or health, and if you die, you return to your last save. What''s more, you can only save a grand total of three times. There are a few other unlockable items in New Game+ as well. The limited edition also comes with a copy of Dead Space: Extraction for the Move, which is a nice bonus if you have a Move. All in all, I highly recommend this game to any gamer looking for action, horror, or a great story, but please, play the first game first.\r\n', 532, 16, '2012-08-31 22:56:10', 46, 'no', ':1:16:2:3:2:1:2:1:1:1:1:1:2:2:2:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:55', 'He Speaks!', '2012-08-31 23:05:46', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 77, ':1', '', 'no', '', '', ''),

(534, 'Chrono Trigger [SNES/PS]', '[center][img]http://cdn0.spong.com/pack/c/h/chronotrig31950/_-Chrono-Trigger-SNES-_.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n-Visuals- 9.3/10\r\nThis game is old. Originally coming out on the 16 bit Super Nintendo, Chrono Trigger features sprites. Many newer gamers may be turned off by that simple fact. However, the sprites are drawn very nicely, but what really stands out are the enemy designs and the environments themselves. The color usage is varied and vibrant and movement is jittery and looks fluid (something FFIV seems to have a little problem with). While the graphics, of course, are not on even modern sprite quality levels, they are still charming and easy on the eyes. The PS1 re-release features anime style cutscenes which make for a treat when you come across them. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://nukoda.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/chronotrigger2.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_youDodHPNWo/TJbiRwBIiWI/AAAAAAAAAZk/vmqOK1jOgAU/s1600/Foto%2BChrono%2BTrigger.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n-Sound- 9/10\r\nThe MIDI music is back in all of it''s glory. It was a treat on the SNES and is still a treat to listen to today. The sound track fits the game perfectly with different music for the different time periods in the game. For example, the 1000 AD music is no where close to being the same as the 650000 BC music, or even the 600 AD music. The sound effects are all well done.\r\n\r\n-Game play- 9.4/10\r\nChrono Trigger features the typical ATB battle system found in  most Final Fantasy games of the day. The ATB (Active Time Bar) battle system is a fast paced battle system where you attack once an action bar fills up. This means slower characters will attack less in a given battle but fast characters will see their bar charge more quickly and thus attack more. Enemies also attack in this manner, and will attack you even if you are trying to choose a move. It''s fun, but not really the most unique battle system.\r\n\r\nWhat makes the game play in Chrono Trigger so unique is the time traveling aspect of the game. You aren''t traveling to different worlds or even different parts of your world. You are exploring the same area of your world through different time periods. This part of the game is done perfectly. You will see similarities as you explore the time periods, but each period will feel fresh and new. Chrono Trigger also introduces another cool concept to the already awesome time traveling part of the game. Actions that you take in the past will affect what happens in the future, especially towards the end of the game. That and there are at least three different ways to get to the final boss, which can change depending on what you do in the past. It all makes more sense as you play the game, so go play it.\r\n\r\n-Story- 9.8/10\r\nYou start off the game as a kid named Crono (or whatever you want to call him) who attends the Millennium Fair to watch her friend Lucca demonstrate her new teleporter. While there, Crono runs into, literally, a girl named Marle who drops a pendent that she wears. Crono finds the pendent and the two quickly become friends. They both go to see Lucca''s teleporter and both test it out. Crono is teleported to the nearby teleporter without an issue, but Marle''s pendent reacts to the teleporter opening a time gate. Crono, being the brave soul he is, goes in the time gate to save Marle. Thus, the incredible adventure begins. The story is extremely fun and exciting and a memorable cast of characters makes the game''s story head and shoulders above many RPGs. Add in multiple endings and optional characters and you''ve got a story that is nearly perfect.\r\n\r\n-Overall- 9.7/10\r\nI cannot recommend this game enough. If you love a great story with unique game play, you will love this game, despite it''s age. The color usage is very vibrant and the soundtrack is very well done. Now quit reading this and go play the game. Seriously, go play the game.', 534, 16, '2012-08-31 23:32:05', 46, 'no', ':16:2:1:3:2:1:2:1:1:1:1:1:2:2:2:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:55', 'Review was written from both the SNES and PS1 versions', '2012-08-31 23:32:05', 0, 0, 0, 0, 16, 94, '', '', 'no', '', '', ''),

Nonprofessional e-mails will be ignored and marked as spam, so make it sound as professional as you can. Right now we don''t really have any requirements other than that your site needs to be video-game-themed. DreamSpand Gaming is still growing and it will most likely be a while before things really start to take off, but affiliation is a great step in the right direction.\n\nThe system is setup very special: when a user clicks on one of our partners, the "hits out" for that particular site goes up by 1. Likewise, when someone clicks our link from the other site, then our "hits in" for that particular site goes up by 1. This helps us track web traffic a little bit better and see how we''re doing on other web sites. Note that the site regularly checks its partners to see if the banner and link are there, and if it does not find them, the admins are notified about it and are prompted to take action (meaning deletion). Linking to each other is not a one-way-street.\n\nPlease, if you wish to link with us, send me an e-mail. I would be more than happy to talk about it, provided your e-mail is legible.

(652, 'Dreamer Chao System Manual', 'Hello, {display}! Welcome to the Official Dreamer Chao System Manual. So, just what exactly [i]is[/i] the Dreamer Chao System? Well, it originally came from a discontinued web site called The Ultimate Chao Garden, also built by me. It was the most popular feature of the site, made entirely from scratch and completely web-and-server-based. In other words, no downloads are required! In the future, it will hopefully be a game written in Java, with more features and interactions. In the first section of this manual, we''ll go in depth to talk about the system and what it is.\r\n\r\n[size=6][b]Contents: [/b][/size]\r\n\r\n[link=#About]1. About[/link]\r\n[link=#DCHome]2.

About]"Dreamer Chao" is a spin off of the chao raising system in the games Sonic Adventure 1 & 2. Although chao are seen in other games, they are only virtual pets on those two, except for on handheld devices such as the GBA. Although chao originated from SEGA, we are by no means endorsed or affiliated with them or Sonic Team by any means. We are an independent site from them and the DC System is simply a fan-made game. All content created by aforementioned companies is copyright to their respected authors and no copyright infringement is intended. Although help for spriting and other images was provided, the system itself was written by me (with aid from the owner of the Chao World web site), by hand, no programs or game makers were used. Years of work has gone into this creation of mine; I started working on it when I was 17 in 2007. It shares a lot of similarities to the original, company-created games, but also incorporates some of its own, unique features and design. Just as the site is constantly receiving updates, so is the DC system. The following sections will talk more in-depth about what each feature does and what all you can get out of the system.\r\n[anchor=DCHome]\r\n[section=2. DC Home]On the homepage of the DC System, every single chao in existence is listed on the page that you''re currently viewing, along with their owners and overall stats. The chao are organized by their overall stats, from highest to lowest. Max stats and levels are always shifting, and so long as the system isn''t abused, they should stay high. You can click on a chao to view it.\r\n[anchor=chaoCreate]\r\n[section=3. Creating Your First Chao]Creating a chao is very easy. Simply click on the create a chao button and give it a name. Names can have up to 7 characters. After your chao is created, you will be redirected to the "viewing" page. From there, you can interact with your chao.\r\n[anchor=adopt]\r\n[section=4. Adoption Forest]This is where "disowned" chao go. While viewing a specific chao, players have the option to "disown" the chao, and this is where they go. The area is viewable and works much like the homepage of the system, except that upon viewing them, players have the opportunity to "adopt" the chao, making it one of theirs. After the chao is "adopted," it will be no different than if you were to hatch it yourself.\r\n[anchor=myChao]\r\n[section=5. My Chao]Works very similar to the homepage, but all of the chao are yours. The current maximum amount of chao a player can have is [b]24[/b], although the player should realize that having that many chao could be a lot of work and could drive them nuts, kinda like a crazy cat lady but with chao.\r\n[anchor=breed]\r\n[section=6. Breeding Center]This is where you can mate two of your [b]adult[/b] chao (babies cannot mate for obvious reasons but we won''t go there). Upon mating (bow-chick-a-wow-wow), the baby''s stats and grades are randomized. Also, if you mate an invisible chao with a regular chao, there''s a chance it might be invisible, and a chance it might be regular - the selection is entirely random. It should also be noted that Chaos Chao (as well as chao from the shop) cannot mate either, as this was the case in the real game.\r\n[anchor=trade]\r\n[section=7. Trading Center]In this area, you can trade your Dreamer Chao with other players. Any chao can be traded, whether adult or not. The system can be kind of confusing and complicated, so we''ll talk about how it works. Try to follow along. :p\r\n\r\nTo make an offer to another member, click on the link that says "click here" upon viewing the Trading Center. You will be sent to a page containing clickable images of all of your chao. Click on the one you wish to mentally scar (just kidding) and then you''ll be taken to the next page. This page is where you give the username of the player that you wish to make this offer to. Type in their [b]USERNAME[/b] (this can be obtained from their profile by what follows the bold text that says "Username: ") and click on the "Continue" button. A PM will be sent to the player by [user=3] regarding the new offer. Note that if the trade is not accepted or denied after 3 days, you will resume ownership of it. From there on out it''s pretty self-explanatory, the other player simply accepts or denies the trade and a PM will be sent to you about it. You can cancel any trade offer at any time.\r\n[anchor=chaoMart]\r\n[section=8. Chao Mart]\r\nChao Mart is where players can buy special chao for a rather pricey.. er.. price. These chao are immortal, and may not be traded or cloned (more on that later), due to the fact that it would cheat the shop, nor can they be bred (as this was the case in the real, company-made game) or readopted. If a shop chao is disowned, it will not go to the Adoption Forest; it will cease to exist. Use this feature wisely, don''t spend your tokens on something that you''re not going to keep. If you want a little bit of reimbursement for your chao, then simply sell it. It will still cease to exist, but you will get half of the original price you paid for it plus the equivalent amount for whatever stats it has at the time of the selling (also more on that later).\r\n[anchor=chaoGardens]\r\n[section=9. Big Gardens]This is where you can view multiple chao at once and take care of them individually. Each garden (Hero, Neutral, Dark and Shiny) has a certain alignment, and chao that meet this alignment will be in their corresponding garden. Click on a chao to make it the one you want to improve the stats of, and then feed it fruit as you would regularly. They do not currently evolve when in this mode, nor do currently they die, so take advantage of it.\r\n[anchor=blackMarket]\r\n[section=10. Black Market]The Black Market is where you can obtain the seven Chaos Emeralds (for the Chaos 0 chao.... and a few others) as well as an invisible chao egg. Each of these items are very expensive, each emerald being 20,000 and the invisible chao egg being 10,000. It would be wise not to buy them all at once, even if you could.\r\n[anchor=sellChao]\r\n[section=11. Sell Chao]It''s very easy to sell a chao that you don''t want, but keep in mind that it is entirely impossible to get it back. This feature was introduced for two reasons:\r\n\r\n 1.) On the original site, "rings" (the equivalent of tokens here) were hard to come by and scarce when you did. Compared to the original expense of taking care of a single chao, let alone multiple, different chao, they didn''t add up, so this feature was introduced to help circulate a little bit more value for the site''s monetary system, and that has been carried over to this web site too.\r\n\r\n 2.) There got to be so many Dreamer Chao in the Adoption Forest that no one would adopt so they just sat there; users would create a chao and then abandon it like a terrible, unworthy parent. This feature was introduced to help reduce that a bit. Extra things will be implemented to prevent this entirely, but for now just have some courtesy. \r\n\r\nEach time you view your chao, the total sum it sells for is recalculated. Once you go to the sell page, it once again is recalculated just to be sure. First, your chao''s overall experience is noted. Afterwards, a check is done to see if it was a chao that was bought from Chao Mart, and if it is, it''s half of what you paid for the original chao. Its happiness is then divided by 2. Lastly, if your chao has any Chaos Emeralds (only available for the Chaos 0-6 Chao), each is multiplied by 100. All of it is added up and the "End Price" is what the chao sells for. If the price is to your liking, then click on "Sell My Dreamer Chao!" and you will not see it again.\r\n\r\n[b]NOTE: [/b] This does NOT promote slavery. Dreamer Chao are free individuals and should not be treated like worker bees. We will call ChaoFACS on you. Be a good parent or don''t be one at all.\r\n[anchor=cloneChao]\r\n[section=12. Cloning Chao]\r\nIf you have at least 900 gamer points, you can clone one of your chao for 200 tokens. Any chao can be cloned at any time, you just have to pay each time.\r\n[anchor=#last]\r\n[section=End]\r\nAnd that''s all there is to know about how the system works!

Hatching]Hatching the chao is probably the absolute easiest part of the game: you just pet it five times. To pet your chao, click on the glove icon. It increases your chao''s happiness by 1 each time. For your chao to hatch, its happiness must be at least 5.\r\n\r\n[anchor=#abuse][section=2. Disciplining]To "discipline" your chao, click on the little twister icon next to the glove. Unfortunately right now the chao doesn''t really "learn" anything, nor will it do anything to get into trouble, but I hope to have that fixed by version 5. All it does right now is decrease your chao''s happiness by 2. Different alignments are dependent upon a certain level of happiness, and that is why this was introduced. If you abuse it too much, though, it will run away, which will cost you tokens. For each time it runs away, the amount you will be charged is multiplied by 1. Don''t abuse your chao. You never know what The Guardians might do..\r\n\r\n[anchor=rename][section=3. Renaming]If you don''t like the name you gave your Dreamer Chao upon creating it, you may rename it at any time. Just like the original, though, it may only contain up to 7 characters. The name takes effect immediately, and it''s all done without leaving the page.\r\n\r\nTo rename your Dreamer Chao, click on the white GBA icon.\r\n[anchor=abandon][section=4. Disowning]If you don''t love your chao anymore and want to get rid of it, click on the green weed icon to disown it. It will go to the Adoption Forest where, hopefully, it will find a more loving home with someone that won''t abandon it, you terrible, unworthy parent! Currently, you may readopt a chao that you disown, but I do plan to fix this, and soon.\r\n\r\n[b]Note: [/b] Chao bought from the shop as well as Chaos Chao will NOT go to the Adoption Forest; they will cease to exist, so keep that in mind.\r\n\r\n[anchor=stats][section=5. Stats]Your Dreamer Chao (currently) has five stats: [list]\r\n[*]Swim     (Fruit: Tokens - 5; Happiness: + 2)\r\n[*]Fly      (Fruit: Tokens - 5; Happiness: + 5)\r\n[*]Run      (Fruit: Tokens - 5; Happiness: - 3)\r\n[*]Power    (Fruit: Tokens - 5; Happiness: - 5)\r\n[*]Stamina  (Fruit: Tokens - 5; Happiness: + 1)\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nTo increase these stats, feed your chao the corresponding fruit. They are ordered from left to right, from swim to stamina. Each fruit will either increase or decrease your chao''s happiness.\r\n\r\nFeeding your chao is easy. Simply click on the "Fruit" link to show the section containing each fruit. Click on the fruit you want to buy, and it will be added to the garden. Click on the fruit again to feed it to your chao. The last two fruit are special, one being a Strong Fruit and the other being a Cube Fruit. The Strong Fruit increases your chao''s power stat and helps it live longer. The Cube Fruit increases your chao''s swim stat and causes it to age faster. Note that each of these fruit cost 500 tokens, one of them increasing happiness and the other lowering it.\r\n\r\nEach stat has a different evolution, and each evolution is different for each alignment. Each alignment is dependent upon the chao''s happiness levels (more on this later).\r\n\r\nStats have levels and experience. Levels can currently get up to 100, and stats can get up to 99,999 (a huge improvement from the last version). Your chao''s experience is the three numbers by the stat bars, in thousandths. The chao''s experience stats are added up and then divided by 5 to determine their overall experience. Certain levels of experience are needed for different types of evolutions.\r\n\r\nThere are a total of 375 different evolutions, and counting the invisible chao, there are 750. That''s not counting the chaos chao or the shop chao - the gene pool is endless!\r\n\r\nThe six grey bars next to your chao''s experience levels are the progress bars that monitor how far you have to go until you reach the next level in that particular stat. The progress is yellow, and the empty are grey. Once the yellow reaches the end, and it increases again, the chao''s stats and levels will go up.\r\n\r\n[anchor=align][section=6. Alignments]There are four different alignments for Dreamer Chao (three main): Hero, Neutral, Dark and Special (for chao from the shop). A chao''s alignment is determined by its happiness levels. "Special" chao are chao that, essentially, have no alignment, because they are either bought or raised by unique means. Once a chao is evolved, its alignment cannot be changed.\r\n\r\n[anchor=firstEvo][section=7. First Evolution]Your chao will go through two evolutions, the first being a combination of its alignment and stat with the greatest experience, and a second being simply the latter. \r\n\r\nTo evolve your chao, first its stamina level must reach 15. Then a check is performed to see which stat has the highest [b]experience[/b] (as in, not the highest level), after which the respective evolution is chosen and applied.\r\n\r\nThe stat of the evolution that your chao evolved into will have its grade increased. Chao have a grading curve, organized below, with E being the worst and X being the best: [list]\r\n[*]E\r\n[*]D\r\n[*]C\r\n[*]B\r\n[*]A\r\n[*]S\r\n[*]X\r\n[/list]The "X" grade is brand new; before the X grade was added, S was the highest grade. Note though, that although stats improve dramatically with an X grade, some special chao are only obtainable through S grades, so try not to go past an S if you want a Chaos Chao or any other form of special chao. When raising your chao''s stats, the amount the experience goes up by is determined by how good the chao''s grade for that particular stat is.\r\n\r\n[anchor=secondEvo][section=8. Second Evolution]When your chao''s age reaches 2, it will go through its second evolution. The second evolution is determined much like the first (except for the alignment), meaning that whatever stat has the highest experience is the type that is chosen. Each first evolution has a second (swim, fly, run, power and stamina), the original being the base. Once the evolution is achieved, the corresponding grade of the respective stat will increase.\r\n\r\n[anchor=reincarnation][section=9. Reincarnation]When your chao reaches age 5, one of two things happen: either it will die and be gone forever, or it will reincarnate and be a child again. Reincarnation is special because it remembers the data from the chao''s past life. If your chao reincarnates, all of it''s stat levels are set back to 1, and its experience levels are halved. Your chao''s "times reincarnated" will also go up (certain, special evolutions require a certain number of reincarnations). [b]There are a handful of chao that do not die or reincarnate, but stay immortal, such as shop chao or Chaos Chao.[/b]\r\n\r\nTo make your chao reincarnate, it must love you - a lot. Its happiness must be at or above 100. If it is any less than that, even 99, it will simply die. Chao that die are (currently) wiped from existence, so keep this in mind when raising different types.\r\n\r\n[anchor=aging][section=10. Aging]The Dreamer Chao aging process is very unique: for each view of your chao (as in when you refresh the page or come back to it), there is a hidden integer that either goes up by 0 or 1. Once this integer reaches 30, your chao''s age goes up by 1. Some chao live past age 5, but typically that''s when they either reincarnate or die (mentioned above).\r\n\r\n[anchor=chaosEmeralds][section=11. Chaos Emeralds]The Chaos Emeralds can be bought from the Black Market for 20,000 tokens a piece (price may decrease a bit, it depends). Certain chao from the shop (as well as chao you can raise) can be given these emeralds. Not only do the emeralds increase your chao''s selling price, but once the chao has all seven, it will change into something else. For instance, a Sonic Chao will become a Super Sonic Chao, a Shadow Chao will become a Super Shadow Chao, etc. There are quite a few hidden evolutions for the users to find for themselves - do some experimenting and you may find them all!\r\n\r\n[anchor=chaosChao][section=12. Chaos Chao]Chaos Chao are a few of the hidden evolutions, and although they have "chaos" in their name, they do not need the emeralds at all. These chao do not die, nor will they go to the Adoption Forest upon disowning them (they will cease to exist).

(691, 'To the Moon [PC]', '[center][img]http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/9/99138/2020143-to_the_moon_poster2_large.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n-Visuals- 8.5/10\r\nTo the Moon was developed with RPG Maker, meaning that sprite based graphics are what you should expect. What really stands out in this game is the color usage. Earth tones are used keeping a sense of realism to a game where it would be easy to lose that. Atmosphere is very well done thanks to the color usage, as well as the static used during the memories. The memory then clarifies after all the links are found (more on that in a bit) which then shows off the great color choices. But being perfectly honest, the visuals of this game take a back seat to the music and story telling. The visuals simply get the job done despite the humble use of RPG Maker.\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://freebirdgames.com/system/wp-content/uploads/TTM-Ss3.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://freebirdgames.com/system/wp-content/uploads/TTM0.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n-Sound- 9.9/10\r\nThe soundtrack is amazing. It never overpowers the scene, and listened to without playing the game, its just some nice music. The way it fits the story and mood of the game, however, is what makes it amazing. From the opening theme, to the tune Johnny composes for his wife, to the end theme, the piano melodies are peaceful, somber, and uplifting all at the same time. The other tunes also are perfect for the scenes they are used at. In short, the music adds to the game without taking over the scene or being too fancy. Sticking to a more simple soundtrack benefits the story telling in this game a lot. So don''t expect epic musical scores, but simple peaceful piano melodies. (Also, the one song with actual lyrics is perfectly placed and sung. Right in my feels).\r\n\r\n\r\n-Gameplay- 8.5/10\r\nThere really isn''t much game play, and what game play there is can get clumsy at times. Essentially you have to find the memory links to move through Johnny''s memories. To do that, you simply walk around and click the object. There are one or two little mini games involved. After you find all 5 memory links in a memory to move forward (backwards?) you have to solve a very simple puzzle. There are no time limits to any story elements and no penalties for taking a while on puzzles. Movement can be a bit clumsy at times and a later mini game controls pretty poorly towards the end of the game, but the lack of punishment for messing up makes up for this. Otherwise, To the Moon plays out more like a digital novel. Simply click to advance the story type gameplay. That isn''t a bad thing in this case either.\r\n\r\n-Story- 10/10\r\nThis is where To the Moon shines. Dr. Eva Rosalene and Dr. Neil Watts are very special doctors. They use technology to give people another chance at life through their memories, basically granting their patients greatest wish. But due to the nature of having two lifetimes worth of memories, the procedure can only be done to someone on their deathbed. The doctors enter their patients memories and witness those memories back to childhood then transfer that wish over, giving their dying patient a new life all inside their head. The patient then would have a few moments of bliss before passing away. Our two doctors are answering another routine call for a man named Johnny, who has only hours left to live. They enter his memories to find out his greatest wish. The wish, is to go to the moon. The problem is, Johnny has no idea why he wants to go. It''s up to the two doctors to piece together the puzzle and fulfill his wish.\r\n\r\nThrough the two doctors, we watch Johnny''s life unfold in reverse chronological order. And because of this, it makes things more suspenseful as we see effects of his decisions before we see the cause of his decisions. Johnny, himself is a deep complex character who shows many flaws making him feel even more human. Interestingly enough, Eva and Neil both are deep characters as well and their banter and observations are very interesting to see.  What makes things even more interesting is that we can only see what Johnny remembers. This makes for some powerful scenes and object symbolism. \r\nThe story is why I am in love with this game. It''s extremely powerful and emotional to witness the triumphs and tragedies in Johnny''s life. It is one of my favorite stories ever told in video games, or even one of my favorite stories ever. I loved every second of it.\r\n\r\n-Overall- 9.8/10\r\nI loved this game, and I am having a hard time putting it into words just how great of a game this is. While it lacks gameplay and the visuals are basic, the story and music are nearly perfect and powerful making To the Moon one of the best ways I have spent have spent 3 hours. In whole, the game stands up better than broken apart and rated like we do here (hence the very high overall score). It is fairly short, but is not rushed and is fully fleshed out. I urge you to take the $10 plunge and watch this incredible story unfold.

The game is bright and filled with incredible scenery that certainly adds to the feel of the game. The character designs are well done. Each characters look mirrors their personality. The game is set in a post- apocalyptic world where mechs have taken control. Unlike Fallout 3 or Bioshock, Enslaved manages to pull off a believable post- apocalyptic world without having to resort to dark coloring, which is an accomplishment. Don''t worry about poor overall graphics in this game, as everything is rendered nicely. I found no issues with frame rate or graphical glitches, but i can''t speak for others.\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/b24a3535a340-580.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4097/4777033369_276d13affd.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n-Sound- 9.5/10\r\n\r\nThe voice acting in Enslaved is some of the best that I have ever heard in a game. Andy Serkis does a great job voicing for Monkey and the acting for Trip is just as good as Monkey''s. Both actors convey emotion and heart into the voices, adding even more to the characters. The music was unnoticeable to me, which is not a bad thing by any means. In fact, it adds to the environment of this game. Besides the two main characters, there is only one other character who makes an appearance, so the music not being noticed makes the game feel more real to me.\r\n\r\n-Game play- 7.5/10\r\n\r\nIt''s repetitive, I''ll say that much. Almost all the missions follow this pattern; jump around, open a door, protect Trip, beat boss, repeat. It''s almost too easy. The platforming aspect of this game just requires the player of being capable of pressing X. The fighting is the high point of the game play. You can use light and heavy attacks as well as a staff that can shoot some sort of bullet thing (I really can''t remember what it was). Some mechs have shields that require deactivating, while some are just flat out big. Defeating the mechs is often a puzzle as you have to quickly decide which pose the largest threat to you or Trip, and act accordingly. A mech might be defective allowing you to take control of it and use it to deactivate another mech''s shield, or eliminate numerous mechs at once. Monkey has a shield that allows him to sustain a certain number of hits before his health bar drains. With upgrades, the shield power can be increased. The controls for Monkey feel sluggish at times, but this doesn''t affect the game play too much. Telling Trip what to do is as easy as pressing a single button, which makes it easy to move her out of harms way if you are caught in a large fight. All in all, not too bad, but not great.\r\n\r\n-Story- 7.5/10\r\n\r\nUp until the end, the story could be a 9/10 or better. Pretty much, you play as a lonely man named Monkey. Monkey is captured by slavers and is being transported on a large ship when a young woman breaks out. Monkey too manages to escape, much to the woman''s displeasure. He is knocked out upon escape by the woman. When Monkey wakes up, he finds that she has placed a device on his head that enslaves him to her. She tells him that her name is Trip and that he has to help her get back home. Much to Monkey''s anger, Trip tells him that if she dies, then he too will die. The character development is incredible and the story is extremely mysterious. I found myself playing 3 hours a day, just to figure out where the story was heading. Unfortunately, the ending was absolutely disappointing. The story ends, but I felt cheated at the lack of any character conclusion. \r\n\r\n-Overall- 8.5/10\r\n\r\nEnslaved was a welcome surprise to me. By using bright vivid colors, engaging characters, incredible voice acting, funny dialogue, and solid game play, Enslaved manages to capture your attention and hold it for the duration of the game. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a relaxed game with a good story.

You will be right at home playing Persona 4 Arena. For story/dialogue sequences, the exact same character models used in Persona 4 are back. Yu (the protagonist in Persona 4) has had his expressions expanded on to account for the fact that he has a personality now. As for the Persona 3 characters, they look as I imagnined they would look a few years after Persona 3. Aigis is the only one not to age for the obvious reasons. Clothing for the Persona 3 characters is pretty silly though, but allows for a few jokes from other characters. As for the actual fighting part of the game, it looks fantastic. Drawn up by the folks at Arc System Works, the guys responsible for the popular BlazBlue series as well as Guilty Gear, the animated sprites in the fighting portions of the game are bright, vibrant and just a treat to look at. When fighting, there is a lot going on in the screen. Cut ins appear when using a special attack, elemental spells are flying all over the place, and the characters are doing the same. It was sometimes a bit overwhelming, but surprisingly, there were no frame rate drops of random freezes. The background for each stage is also drawn very well, but with moving parts in some of them, it only adds to the confusion at times when a lot is popping up on screen. One final complaint is the lack of variation in between backgrounds in the story mode. It gets very annoying to see the same background multiple times in a story arc, and more annoying having to see it multiple times in over 10 story arcs.\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://media1.gameinformer.com/imagefeed/featured/atlus/persona/person-4-arena/persona4areanposte3screens_610.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://media.gamerevolution.com/images/games/ps3/persona-4-arena/persona-4-arena_015.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n-Sound- 9.5/10\r\n\r\nLets start with the biggest part of voice acting. Yu Narukami speaks. Voiced by Johnney Yong Bosch of Code Geass fame (Lelouch if you were wondering), he is a dynamic character who is very protective of the ones he cares for.  The voice acting for Yuu is perfectly done, and not at all outside what I imagined for his voice. Teddie also has a new voice actor, and he comes off surprisingly well. I had my reservations about the new voice from the trailers, but I can safely say, it works out nicely. Chie is our final character with a new voice actress, and is the worst of the bunch. While not bad, she simply comes across as a bit generic. As for the rest of the voice acting, it\\''s top notch as nearly all Atlus titles are. The music is a solid mixture of tunes from Persona 3 and 4 along with some new pieces and arrangements. It certainly feels like Persona 3 and 4 when it comes to the music. \r\n\r\n-Gameplay- 8/10\r\n\r\nFighting games are not my specialty. I never can learn the combo\\''s, techniques, or even the terminology of the games. Instead, I smash random buttons like a lunatic hoping to land hits on my enemy. So I am not the person to talk about how this game play compared to other fighting games. That all being said, P4A is very easy to learn and play, at least in story mode. The battles in story mode are simply one round bouts that never last longer than a minute at the most. During a characters story, you may fight 5-8 battles, none of which are too difficult. Arc System Works included a very simple tutorial that introduces you to the major concepts of the game. 10 minutes of the tutorial had me more than prepared for the story mode. Arcade mode is tougher but challenge mode is where the true difficulty is. My complaint lies mainly with story mode. There is a lot of story, but no gameplay in it. For a Persona title, there is little to no choice and the story is a rather linear affair. Luckily, the story more than hold up to the added pressure of carrying this title.\r\n\r\n-Story- 9.5/10\r\n\r\nPicking up a couple of months after Persona 4, Persona 4 Arena starts off with Yuu coming back to Inaba to visit his friends. Yuu and his friends had recently solved a serial murder case taking place in the town of Inaba by using their Personas and entering something called the TV world, where they would rescue people thrown in to the TV. Staying in the TV too long without a Personas protection means death. When the murders where taking place, a mysterious program would come on television at midnight on rainy evenings showing who the next victim would be. Yuu and his friends believe that they would get to celebrate Yuu returning and have a nice party with the entire Investigation Squad that they had formed during Persona 4, that is until the Midnight Channel suddenly shows all of them in a fighting tournament seemingly run by Teddie.\r\n\r\nGet all that? Remember, this is a fighting game? Well it has the story of a fully fledged RPG. Persona 3 characters are tied in nicely and our new character, Labrys is luckily extremely interesting and fully fleshed out. The story is magnificently done and has huge implications for the future of the Persona franchise. And I mean [b]huge[/b] implications. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://media.gamerevolution.com/images/games/ps3/persona-4-arena/persona-4-arena_022.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n-Overall- 9/10\r\n\r\nFun, exciting, challenging, deep, and yet simple. Persona 4 Arena is a well designed title that adds a lot to the Persona franchise. It never once felt like a cash in on the most popular entry in the series (Persona 4) and lays the foundations for an exciting future for the series. The reception among fighting game fans and pro\\''s has been solid so far and as a Persona fan, I enjoyed this title immensely. Somehow, Atlus and Arc System Works created a genre switch and it works out almost perfectly.

(932, 'Reccetear: An Item Shop''s Tale [PC]', '[center][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/WBfO5.jpg[/IMG][/center]\r\n\r\n-Visuals- 7.5/10\r\nSolid, but unimpressive in anyway. The graphics are done through the use of sprites which are well drawn and colorful, and the environments are drawn out very nicely too, albeit, a bit cartoonish. Them being cartoonish is not a bad thing, and fits the mood of the game as a light- hearted economy game. Each individual item is unique looking and the dialogue scenes are done in a visual novel esque way with an anime portrait of a character being displayed with text running at the bottom. As I said, the visuals are solid, but do not really stand out in anyway. This game lacks a visual identity, and while drawn fairly well, it comes off as generic. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/01/Recettear_Dungeon.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://www.rpgamer.com/games/other/pc/recettear/screens/recettear24.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n-Sound- 7/10\r\nNo english dub here, and not every line is voice acted in Japanese. Still, the Japanese voice acting is done well and did not seem out of place. The music is simple, but does it''s job and keeps the game up beat which is fitting for the story. There just isn''t a whole lot to be said about the sounds of this game.\r\n\r\n-Gameplay- 8.5/10\r\nOnce again, solid, but how long it manages to hold you until you get bored is the key question. In this game, you run an item shop. So, you have to keep your shelves stocked and try to repay a massive loan by turning out a profit. To keep your shelves stocked, you have to buy items from other sellers and then resell those items. As the game progresses, more and more things to keep up with are added, such as advance orders, arrangement of shelves, the style of walls and flooring in your shop, the world economy, and even item placement. The items that you really want to sell should be placed on the window displays for example. This will bring more customers in to buy. As you level up your merchant rank, more items and options are unlocked. For that reason, failing to meet the loan repayment objective is not always a bad thing. Yes, the game will start over, but the items you have and your merchant level remain unchanged, making it easier to hit the goal you missed. When someone wants to buy an item, a dialogue will open as you haggle about the price. Customers may come in to sell items as well, in which case you must again haggle a price. Finally, the world economy can heavily affect how much you can sell items for. For example, should their be book craze, people will be more willing to buy books for a higher price, but conversely, if their was a huge harvest, food prices will drop and you may end up selling food at a loss. Once the item shop aspect of the game is mastered, it becomes a fairly simple game to play. \r\n\r\nThere is also a dungeon crawling aspect to the game. You may charter an adventurer to go into dungeons for you. When you do this, you play as the adventurer in a hack and slash action RPG. One button does your main attack, and another does your special. Traps are in the dungeon along with plenty of enemies. Completing dungeons will hopefully bring you essentially free items that you can sell. Time management is important though. The day is divided up into four parts. Exiting your shop to go shopping will cost one part of the day, but it doesn''t count until you re-enter your shop. That way you can do all your shopping at once, for just one part of the day. Going into a dungeon though, will cost you two parts of the day. So be careful with how you spend time in this game, as loan repayment deadlines will creep up on you very quickly. The main downside to this game, is that it simply may not hold your attention for very long as it is simple once learned.\r\n\r\nStory- 8/10\r\nThe story really takes a back seat to the gameplay. You play as Reccete, who''s father has gone on an adventure, but seems to have died outside of the town fighting a dragon while standing on the edge of a volcano (the scene is actually comedic somehow, kudos for that). Unfortunately for Reccete, her dad took out a massive loan before leaving, and with his death, the debt transfers to her. A debt collector fairy named Tear comes to collect the loan, but knows Reccete can''t pay it off. So she offers to help Reccete run an item shop. What to call this shop though? Reccetear of course! The story and characters are all funny and light hearted, if not strange and eccentric. Early in the game, the antagonist (if their even is one) is caught sneaking into your shop to spy in a top secret disguise that would make Solid Snake proud (in a cardboard box). Expect that sort of humor. It''s simply a happy game.\r\n\r\n-Overall- 8/10\r\nReccetear is a fun game, but one that may have trouble holding your attention. It features solid, but generic visuals with gameplay that seems complex, but once learned is simple to play. After paying off the loan, you can continue playing in one of two ways. One way involves difficult profit goals for you to meet, while the other is just a simple free mode, where there are no monetary goals. I picked this game up cheap in a Steam sale, and it was worth the few dollars I paid. Luckily, their is a very good demo on Steam for this game, so if you are unsure about forking over the $20, pick up the free demo and see what you think.

The way this will work is very simple: simply design your profile to resemble your favorite character from a video game, movie, etc. As long as it''s PG-13, you''re good. New options of "species" have been added to aid your chances in this contest (you can change your species by modifying your profile). Change your name colors, use a custom title, make a nice signature, have a great avatar, change your personal quote, and make sure they''re all related to one subject. You don''t have to change them all, but it would greatly help your chances of winning.\r\n\r\nOn October 31st, we will open a poll, and each user that participated in the contest will be a candidate. In order to OFFICIALLY participate, though, you need to customize your profile, and then post here telling us that you''d like to enter (if you don''t enter, you can''t be added to the polls). The site''s users will then vote on who had their favorite profile. Yes, you can vote for yourself. Whoever gets the most votes by the end of the poll, that as of yet has not received a deadline, will win the contest.\r\n\r\nThe prizes are currently pending and are subject to change, but it won''t be without notice. They include a PS+ membership, 2,000 tokens, a site medal for winning the contest, another site medal for winning the [i]Hell-O-Ween[/i] contest, +1 Reputation (this way, users who have a low rep can still get the Good Karma achievement), and more (a detailed list of prizes is below).\r\n\r\nGet creative, go crazy, try your best and most importantly, have fun.

The game was released in October, and has come up from 1.2 million users since December. Although the game is free to play, "Happy Tickets" can be purchased with real world money to customize your character''s appearance and equipment, which can also be achieved by unlocking "Happy Stars" through game-play. The player must have an X-Box Live Gold account ($5 per month, $60 per year) in order to download this game. \r\n\r\nThe new update includes a Special Match Mode that introduces new multiplayer rules, and added more customization slots from one to three. The update also extended the level cap for items from 10 to 15. Happy Wars supports simultaneous play of 30 players (as in 15 vs 15), who must attack their opponent''s castle while guarding their own. This game is the first free-to-play game for XBL, but certainly not the last. In several months, another free-to-play game will be released called Ascend: New Gods, and will be a roleplaying game.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Source: [/b] http://www.gamespot.com/news/free-to-play-xbox-live-game-hits-2-million-players-6405103', 1738, 1, '2013-03-11 17:38:00', 46, 'no', ':1:2:16:2:1:1:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:55', 'Free-To-Play X-Box Live game gets "major update."', '2013-03-11 17:38:00', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 67, '', '', 'no', 'gaming, game, xbox, live, free, play, download, microsoft', '', ''),

Same thing goes for PS3 trophies.\n[*]Boards will have their own unique design as opposed to being similar to that of ProBoards. The resemblance of ProBoards was only prior to development until something more creative came along, and I have ideas now. [D]\n[*]Welcome table will have drop-down menus and will not be as cluttered. These menus are recycled from Chao FM, a subsidiary of UCG, one of my last web sites.

In other words, if the regular boards get updated with new features or looks, so will the sub-boards. [D]\n[*]Each board will have several different "categories" of topics, ranging from all topics, topics by your friends, topics that you''ve created, topics that you''ve subscribed to and more. You will also be able to ''ignore'' a topic so it doesn''t show up for you.\n[*]Gamer profiles. You will have a profile separate from your forum one, where your games and such will all be collected.\n[*]"My Games" and "Games That I Want" lists will be provided. Friends who have the same (or similar) games will be mentioned.\n[*]Topics and posts will have "action options" for staff and regular users [D]\n[*]"Pin" Forums.

What you find though is a mystery and as the AI opens up more logs to you, some dirty secrets begin to come out about what really happened aboard the ship. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/solidbatman/screen3.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nWhat stands out about this visual novel is the DOS command line like gameplay at certain parts.

Its well executed and makes you actually feel like you are a detective. The rest of the gameplay is standard visual novel. Pick dialogue choices based off the conversations.

But when i first watched the second trailer, i thought i was going crazy over the repeats...took me a while to process that the scene was being played over and over again. But there is no remake for that mistake? Manga entertainment messed up big time over that, they didnt release another version? hell, put it in the director''s cut edition or something.

(1273, 'My Top 5 Quotes in Games', '[u]Number 5[/u]\r\n\r\n"What is the difference between a man and a parasite? A man builds. A parasite asks ''Where is my share?'' A man creates. A parasite says, ''What will the neighbors think?'' A man invents. A parasite says, ''Watch out, or you might tread on the toes of God... ''"\r\n-Andrew Ryan (Bioshock)\r\n\r\n[i]I love a good political/philosophical study in video games, and this quote by the creator of the great underwater city of Rapture shows exactly how he feels about society, as well what kind of man he is. Turns out he''s a very fascinating man.[/i]\r\n\r\n\r\n[u]Number 4[/u]\r\n\r\n"People die, and Yuna dances. When will she stop dancing? When will it stop? Yuna won''t stop dancing, not until Sin is gone."\r\n\r\n-Tidus (Final Fantasy X)\r\n\r\n[i]Final Fantasy X is an incredible game to play, and it was the first game that really made me tear up. Regardless of how you felt about Tidus (or his diamond pants) he was an extremely real feeling teenager. He would chose to ignore things he did not like and tried to act tough and selfish other times. Then he proved how much he cares for others and how he wants to help people, not just himself when he makes this observation on the dance Yuna has to do to allow the dead to rest in peace. He knows that he must eliminate Sin, a giant monster that tries to destroy Spira.[/i]\r\n\r\n[u]Number 3[/u]\r\n\r\nThe moment man devoured the fruit of knowledge, he sealed his fate... Entrusting his future to the cards, man clings to a dim hope. \r\nYet arcana is the means by which all is revealed. Beyond the beaten Path lies the absolute end.\r\nIt matters not who you are, Death awaits you.\r\n\r\n-Nyx Avatar (Persona 3)\r\n\r\n[i]Nyx Avatar spouts off a ton of hard hitting quotes, but none ring more true than the 13th quote signifying that you are in for a heck of a battle. This quote embodies everything that you are fighting against, and that is just giving up on life and accepting that there is no point. Despite all the good in life, death will end it all. Persona 3 tries to tell us, the gamer, to live life and create bonds as they make life worth living (or at least I felt like thats what the point was).[/i]\r\n\r\n[u]Number 2[/u]\r\n\r\n"F**king blocks... I''m gonna climb the sh*t outta you!" \r\n\r\n-Vincent Brooks (Catherine)\r\n\r\n[i]Catherine was a weird, but fun game. Our protagonist is thrown into a dream world where he must climb towers of blocks to stay alive. While the story deals with infidelity and relationships, the gameplay dealt with climbing blocks. This quote is all you need to know about the gameplay[/i]\r\n\r\n[u]Number 1[/u]\r\n\r\n"Such beauty they hold, these tears of sorrow. But are you worthy to shed such tears? The act of mourning the dead belongs to the realm of humans. The human race, fearful in its weakness, built this world in a futile attempt to elude the abyss they call mortality. Culture?civilization?all delusions created by a powerless race, and of little use, like a barren woman. But amidst all this, you continue to exist as an unfettered soul, free from the shackles of flesh and blood? A completely pure consciousness? An eternal spiral, undefiled by impurities? a fusion of fire, breath, and spirit? What can we call you?but angels? New, unadulterated psyches? But what you lack is reality. And that is what I shall provide you with!" \r\n\r\n-Albedo (Xenosaga Episode I)\r\n\r\n[i]This entire scene is part of my favorite scenes in all of gaming. Albedo shows himself to be a deranged psycho by ripping off his own arm, followed by his own head, just to scare a little girl. Both grow back as he isn''t exactly human to begin with. Nonetheless, he has a very low view on humanity and it''s so called accomplishments. This line of his sums up how he views humanity, and the joy he takes in showing these failings to others. In short, this line makes Albedo my favorite villain in gaming.[/i]\r\n', 1273, 16, '2012-11-17 20:45:53', 46, 'no', ':1:16:34:2:1:2:2:2:2:1:1:9:1:1:1:1:1:1:2:1:1:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:55', 'No Description', '2012-12-03 15:53:28', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 95, '', '', 'no', '', '', ''),

America is undergoing many changes politically and demographically, and our protagonists are getting introduced to the rest of the Fears! Can they team up with more protagonists, and is it even possible to find answers at this point?\r\n\r\n[b]Act III: (The Duels of) The Knights of Xanadu[/b] Fate is late! The protagonists are starting to really experience the traumas of the apocalypse! As The Anathema builds up something called "The Neonate" and The Beast''s presence starts to surface, our protagonists are beginning to wonder who the real antagonists are!\r\n\r\n[b]Act IV: The Hunt (of The Beast and The Harlot, The Seven Beacons, and The Terminal Coming of Rapture)[/b] The end is fear! Good portions of the Earth are in Xanadu, and our protagonists have a lot of trouble to figure out before October 21st! Even with the helpful help of Fears Salmacis, Tiresias, and The Musicians, can the heroes beat every single apocalypse coming their way?

Getting back on track, the Japanese voice acting is great and each voice matches the personlity of that particular character perfectly. Rei has a very monotone voice, Asuka is loud and sure to let you know her opinion. Shinji is a whiny little immature boy, and is voiced as such. The music of NGE is sweeping and grand. Using classical themes and music, the soundtrack pulls you into the show but even better are the parts with no music. Those scenes are haunting and gives the viewer a sense of isolation that most of these characters feel. Instead of the hustle and bustle of the city, we hear cicada bugs and the wind in the background. It''s an eerie reminder of just how empty the world is after the Second Impact.\r\n\r\n-Characters- 7.5/10\r\nWhile the characters are well defined, outside of Shinji, our main protagonist, I don''t feel as if any of the characters are as defined as they could have been. Instead we get snippets and brief flashes of just who the characters are, but Shinji gets the main focus. That is understandable, but when you make a character as unlikable as Shinji, naturally, you want to know more about the other characters. \r\n\r\nShinji is a depressed, lonely boy who is just looking for someone, anyone to acknowledge him and accept him. This will wear on the viewers patience as Shinji is usually apathetic about everything and never seems happy. While he gets a lot of hate, he seems like a realistic character, and maybe the most realistic of the show. He is thrust into a situation that he can''t handle and seems to break down. That being said, he still comes across as very selfish and only caring for himself. \r\n\r\n-Story- 8/10\r\nNGE tells the story of an Earth, fighting for it''s survival against a strange group of beings called the Angels. To combat the angels, an organization is set up by the UN called Nerv. Nerv has built synthetic humanoid mechs called Eva units which are able to destroy the angels. The pilots of these mechs though are always younger teens. Shinji Ikari arrives at Nerv at the request of his father, who runs Nerv, to pilot an Eva unit. So begins one of the most confusing, yet thought provoking stories ever told in anime. At times NGE seems to be plodding along with no direction, and very little explanation, and when it does get to explaining things, it does so in a very confusing manner. The final two episodes of the show are a radical departure from the style of the rest of the series, and have very little in the way of action as well as being very confusing. This angered fans so much, that a movie was released to placate the fans. The End of Evangelion is considered the true ending by most fans of the show. Personally, I thought the final two episodes were entertaining. I appreciated the fact that they were experimental and very philisophical, but I am still going to count it against the show because of the sudden change in style and story telling. A show like NGE should not do that. A warning; NGE plays upon Christian beliefs very heavily towards the end and is not acceptable for more conservative viewers because of this, as well as nudity towards the end of the show. \r\n\r\n-Overall- 8/10\r\nNGE is a very well done show, but one that was too ambitious for it''s own good. The story telling at times takes massive hits in quality, along with the animation. NGE was over budget towards the end of the show, which caused a much lower level of quality in the last episodes. While I enjoyed it, it certainly has major flaws, as I''ve stated above. Still, fans of religious story telling, and mecha series that aren''t about the fights should watch this show.

(1297, 'Star Wars: The Old Republic', 'I just need to vent some stuff.\r\n\r\nFor those who don''t know, Star Wars: The Old Republic recently went Free to play. I was subscriber for a while back when the game first released, but put it on hold due to financial restrictions, and certain bugs.\r\n\r\nWhen I heard that Bioware was making the game F2P, at first I was very concerned and disappointed, since up to that point, F2P for new MMO''s meant It wasn''t making enough money.\r\nBut then I tried Guild Wars 2, an MMO who was F2P from the start, and I thought "Maybe there Is still hope for SWTOR, F2P can be awesome".\r\n\r\nWhat Guild Wars 2 does with this model Is only offer either cosmetic items, or single players items. I.E. there is no Pay-To-Win here since you can''t buy high level equipment and the likes.\r\n\r\nSo just now, I gave SWTOR another go, I was pretty excited having played GW2 for a few weeks, and seeing how great F2P can work for MMO''s. But Holy Duck Fuck has Bioware messed up.\r\n\r\nLiterally Everything Is now something you have to purchase for "Cartel Coins", that you buy with real money. Gear, pets, boosts, ACCESS TO FUCKING EXPANSION MISSIONS, and I am not kidding; Emotes.\r\n\r\nWhen they said that free play was "restricted" they really weren''t screwing around. Your character limit is 2. Two. You have to subscribe for more slots. Also, they have merged a whole fuckton of servers, meaning the Very first message I saw after logging in was a requirement to change 2 of my characters names, because someone else on this new server already claimed them.\r\n\r\nThe Legacy system, something new and innovative from Biowares side, allows you to link your different characters across factions and classes to gain unique abilities. You could for instance be a Trooper related to a Jedi, and the Trooper could learn some Force skills and vice versa. Bioware is very proud of this system, and when I first read about it, I was really excited for it.\r\n\r\nNow you have to buy All of your Legacy skills, limiting the entire system for non subscribers to a fucking last name.\r\n\r\nThis might not be directly Pay-to-win, but It''s definitely the worst example of F2P I have seen so far.', 1297, 9, '2012-11-24 23:27:43', 46, 'no', ':16:9:1:1:2:2:2:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:55', 'No Description', '2012-11-25 16:57:19', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 111, '', '', 'no', '', '', ''),

(1344, 'Bioshock 2 [PS3]', 'It''s midnight, still early, but late enough for me to claim I''m too tired to screen grab pictures. Pics later.\r\n\r\n-Visuals- 8.3/10\r\nVisually, Bioshock 2 is the same as [url=http://gamefreaks11.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=gr&action=display&thread=237]Bioshock[/url]. What I mean by that is that Bioshock 2 has the same quality of graphics that the first game had. Why, then, is my score so much lower? It comes down to Rapture, the great underwater city that serves as the location for this game. Sure it looks like Rapture, but it does not feel like Rapture. The awe and mysterious feel of Rapture that the first game managed to capture so well is gone. So while you are in Rapture, it simply feels like a location for the game. The first game managed to make Rapture into a character in a certain way. Rapture was the people, the Little Sisters, the Big Daddies, and the Splicers. Rapture in Bioshock 2 is simply the backdrop and takes a back seat to the story. \r\n\r\nNow if I were to judge based off graphics alone, and not environment, Bioshock 2 looks every bit as good as the first. Built off a heavily modified Unreal 3 engine, the water effects really stand out once again and the engine proves capable of handling a lot of action occurring on screen. I did have one frame rate drop that lasted for a few moments but I believe that to be an isolated problem, not something every gamer will experience. \r\n\r\n\r\n-Sound- 9.5/10\r\nThe sound again shines as it did in the first game. I felt like their was a lot more dialogue in Bioshock 2 than their was in Bioshock, though that may come down to the tighter narrative of the second game. The music is wonderfully done using ominous sounding violin/piano pieces with a mix of ''50s and ''60s music thrown in to match the time period of the game. The voice acting is top notch and all of the performances were executed well. For example, Sinclair is a sleazy man who assists you and he talks like a sleazy salesman, which fits his role perfectly. My only real complaint is the shops. While the Gatherers Garden machines still have their creepy music and slogans, the Circus of Value''s and the ammo machines have lost the creepy dialogue and music. That takes away from the feeling of Rapture, something I mentioned above.\r\n\r\n-Gameplay- 9/10\r\nNearly the same as the first, but streamlined a bit, the gameplay features your favorite plasmids once again, but with new weapons. Plasmids act as your alternate weapon. For example, if you are surrounded by enemies, you could set one on fire using Incinerate, or freeze a couple using a blizzard like plasmid. Maybe you want to have an enemy turret attack it''s own allies? Use the security override plasmid to take control of the turret for a short amount of time. Or maybe you want to throw an enemies grenade back at him. Use telekinesis to catch his grenade and launch it right back into his face. Plasmids are what allow you to clear out enemies in the way you want to clear them out.\r\n\r\nAs for the weapons, the same classes apply as the first game, with minor modifications to reflect the fact that you play as a Big Daddy. You''re new melee weapon is a giant drill and gathering fuel will allow you to spin the drill for extra melee damage. You now also have a rivet gun, that acts as your new pistol. The rivet gun is a nice change from the pistol in large part because of the different ammo types, such as trap rivets or heavy rivets. Other weapons include a spear gun which replaces the mighty crossbow, a heavy machine gun which replaces the smaller tommy gun, and the hold over, the grenade launcher. Different ammo types will give weapons different attacks. Take the trap rivet i mentioned above. Shoot this against a wall and it acts as a trip wire that deals hefty damage to enemies the trip it. The spear gun also has trap ammo, though it deals less damage but electrocutes enemies which stuns them for a moment, a moment you can use to deal a quick death to them. All of these weapons fit in with the new game play mechanic.\r\n\r\nSeeing how you play as a Big Daddy, you can choose to help Little Sisters gather Adam, the currency needed to buy new upgrades for yourself. Much like the first game, you have to eliminate the Big daddy protecting the Little Sister to even have an option with them. Once he is dealt with, you can choose to harvest the sister, which nets you more Adam than any other option. This outs you on the path to the darker endings and you will miss out on gifts left at Gatherer Gardens. The other option is to adopt the Little Sister. Doing this will allow you to assist the Little Sister in gathering Adam as you have to protect her from Splicers, the main enemies in the game. After gathering Adam from two corpses, you have the option once again to harvest her, or save her by releasing her from her Adam addiction. Saving the Sisters will net you less Adam, but puts you on the path for the brighter endings and saving enough Little Sisters will cause them to leave gifts for you, which can include new upgrades or Adam bonuses which allow you to upgrade. I actually found this new way of dealing with the Sisters far more enjoyable than simply killing a Big Daddy and clicking a button. It gave more of a sense of fulfillment as you do more to earn Adam, and also fits your role as a Big Daddy.\r\n\r\n-Story- 9.5/10\r\nThe first Bioshock had a messy, but fun story. Bioshock 2, however, has a much more tightly controlled story that is pieced together with less philosophical musings and more straight forward talk. Don''t be alarmed though, the philosophical and political undertones still exist, they just are not thrown in your face. This fact could account for Rapture feeling less like rapture of Bioshock 1, but it also means the story is easier to digest.\r\n\r\nThe game opens with you following a Little Sister whom is running around Rapture when she comes across trouble. You are subdued, when Sofia Lamb, a political rival of Andrew Ryan, manages to take control of your mind. She informs you that Eleanor, the Little Sister you were protecting, is not your daughter but her daughter. She then orders you to take off your mask and shoot yourself. Fast forward 10 years to 1968, and you awaken from a sort of coma. Now you search for Eleanor and Sofia Lamb. It''s a fun story and has plenty of twists and turns along the way. \r\n\r\n-Overall- 9/10\r\nI personally enjoyed this game more than the first game, though it gets a lower score because of the loss of wonder at Rapture. The game has plenty to offer still with addicting game play, incredible sound work, and a very polished story. If you enjoyed the first game, I promise you will enjoy Bioshock 2.', 1344, 16, '2012-11-29 05:03:55', 46, 'no', ':16:34:2:1:1:2:2:2:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:55', 'I''m a Big Daddy!', '2012-11-29 05:03:55', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 63, ':1', '', 'no', '', '', ''),

The cut scenes look impressive though. Facial animations are nearly non- existent, and sometimes expressions lack any emotional change. Someone may be crying, but they continue to smile as if the mouth is in a fixed position. There really isn''t any wow factor for any non cut scene graphics. In- game playing graphics are a little better than in- game scenes when the camera zooms in on characters and shows the weaknesses of the visuals. The game can get choppy in heavily populated areas and I have had the game freeze on me on more than one occasion. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://ps2media.gamespy.com/ps2/image/inline_2_1093283612.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://gamingtp.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/star-ocean-till-the-end-of-time-1.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n-Sound- 6/10\r\n\r\nThe music is alright but the voice acting really lowers the score. The voice acting is so bad that it often detracts from the story. It can easily take away any emotional effect when the line is timed poorly, or said in an incorrect tone for the situation. The audio levels of the voice overs fluctuate, being very low at some portions of the game, and very high at others.\r\n\r\n-Game play- 9.5/10\r\n\r\nThis game has a very unique battle system, one that I''ve never seen before. You don''t randomly encounter battles in this game. You can see your enemy while walking around. This means you choose when to fight battles for the most part (Boss battles being the exception). Once in a battle, you can only control one character at a time, but you can easily switch between them with a push of a button. The AI will control your other two characters in battle. You can alter the AI strategy for those battles by setting the tactics. Tactics are a set of orders for the AI to follow when controlling your character. Some of these orders are "Attack with all your might", "Act in a balanced manner", and "Conserve your fury". Fury (or Guts in Japan) is a bar that fills when you stand still in a battle. All attacks require a certain percentage of fury. If your fury bar is empty, then you cannot attack or use symbology (magic). As you level up, you gain new attacks just like any other RPG. You take the attacks you learn and assign them one of four buttons. There are only O and X for attacks but depending on how long you hold the button will determine which of the four attacks you use. (You can also assign two support skills ie. Support sybology, first aid.) The battle system is a lot simpler than it sounds, after and hour of playing, I had figured out most of it. Be careful though. Unlike many RPG''s, you can die from losing all your HP or losing all your MP.\r\n\r\nItem creation is another big aspect of the game. Scattered throughout the game are workshops where you can invent items. Based off your skill levels, you will invent new weapons, medicines, books, stones, food, etc. You can also hire inventors if you can find them, and have the item/ money they require. Inventors that you don''t hire will still invent things that you can buy in shops. Any item invented by you or an inventor you hire will be discounted for you at shops. You will also receive a little bit of money for your invention being sold. (Just be sure to patent your item so you can get credit for the invention.) You can also synthesize items, or combine items together. Synthesizing certain stones, charms, etc. will add effects to your weapons, such as increased attack power or immunity from certain elemental attacks. If synthesis fails, your weapon can be weakened or destroyed. All inventing requires money, so be careful that you don''t spend it all on accident when inventing.\r\n\r\nThere is also a versus feature (you have to unlock it by completing an optional dungeon) where you and a friend can battle it out co- op or against each other. This is a mini game unfortunately and the main game is not co -op. I think a drop in- drop out co- op would be a very good addition to the game. Also, you can unlock battle trophies. By completing a certain task in the game, like defeating a boss in under 1 minute or beating a boss without taking damage, you unlock a battle trophy. The more you unlock, the more bonuses you get. This game can easily suck 200- 300 hours from you if you want to get 100% of the trophies.\r\n\r\n-Story- 9.8/10\r\n\r\nYou begin the game on a Pangalactic Federation resort planet called Hydra IV as Fayt Liengod, a college student from Earth. You are on vacation with your parents, Robert and Ryoko, (two famous scientist who study symbology), as well as a close friend, Sophia Esteed. When Hydra IV is attacked by, not the Pangalactic Federations enemy, the Aldian Empire, but a mysterious foe, Fayt and Sophia get split up from Robert and Ryoko. Later when the evacuation ship Fayt and Sophia are on is attacked, the two get split up as well, with Fayt crash laning his escape pod on an under developed planet called Vanguard III. Fayt attempts to find a way to re unite with his family, but he is being followed. \r\nThe story of this game is massive and engaging. My only complaint is that it can be predictable at times, but it makes up for that in plot twists that happen at times and shift the story very quickly. The story takes a bit of time to really get going, but once it does, it doesn''t let up. \r\n\r\n-Overall- 8.5/10\r\n\r\nThe terrible voice acting really hurts this game, but it is a very fun and engaging RPG. There are so many side quests and mini games to play, so if you get bored with the main quest (I doubt it) then you can play those.

If you are squeamish, or easily disturbed by violence, do NOT continue reading.[/i]\r\n\r\n\r\nCorpse Party began as a humble indie RPG Maker survival horror game. It was first released for PC in 1996, before getting a remake titled Corpse Party: Blood Covered in 2008. In 2010, Corpse Party was re-released onto the PSP as Corpse Party: Blood Covered Repeated Fear. It quickly gained a cult following of gamers drawn to the incredible sound, dark, disturbing story, and of course, horrific death scenes. When XSeed brought it to America and Europe in 2011, western gamers finally got a taste of the twisted game. Demand was high enough for XSeed to bring over the sequel/side story, Corpse Party: Book of Shadows earlier this year as well. \r\n\r\nCorpse Party follows a group of students attending Kisaragi Academy who are having a little farewell gathering for one of their classmates who is moving away. The students are telling ghost stories when they try a harmless ritual for fun that will supposedly allow them to remain friends forever. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/solidbatman/CorpsePartyCharacters_zps66105611.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n[center][i]Friends forever?[/i][/center]\r\n\r\nAfter preforming the ritual, a strange earthquake takes place and the students find themselves separated inside a strange rundown school called Heavenly Host Elementary School. The school houses various spirits and ghosts whom are hostile to the students, along with signs of grisly murders, piles of bones, and disturbing messages. The students attempt to meet back up and find a way out, only to find that there is no way out, and they are slowly losing their grip on sanity.\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/solidbatman/Child_spirits_and_Naomis_death_zps260e52e8.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nWhat is so interesting about Corpse Party is how it manages to take sprite based graphics, and turn it into something creepy. While the visuals may not inspire fear, the color usage gives the player a sense of despair. But the visuals are assisted in large part thanks to sound and gameplay. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/solidbatman/corpse-party-screenshot_zpsc37796c8.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n[center][i]This take place before a characters gropes particular body parts of the corpse... I''m not kidding.[/i][/center]\r\n\r\nOn their own, the visuals can give a sense of creepiness, but cannot pull it off. With the 3D stereo sound, the player feels immersed despite the tiny PSP screen. I, more than once, found myself looking around myself when someone would be speaking. I thought at one point, someone was literally behind me whispering. The sound design is that good. As you hear the screams of a child dying, you will feel chills tingling down your back. You will get goosebumps from ghosts whispering in your mind. You will feel like flies are surrounding you. It''s simply stunning what the developers managed to do with the sound.\r\n\r\nAs you navigate the halls of Heavenly Host, you will find various objects and notes that may or may not help you to escape. Death lurks everywhere in Corpse Party. Reading a note may end up killing you later. Uncovering a statue may anger a spirit who will brutally murder you. Picking a wrong dialogue choice, or forgetting to read a note could end in a Wrong End. Death is everywhere. Some players complained about this, but it adds so much to the suspense of the game. You need to explore to find a way out, but exploring can easily kill you. It certainly keeps the player on the edge of his seat. As for the Wrong Ends...\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/solidbatman/Seikos_Death_2_zps8152e9b0.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of graphic ways to die, and the game will spare no expense describing them to you. No one is immune either. The youngest character is an elementary school student, and she too can die in many graphic ways. And if you think the game has horrible death scenes, the comics are much, much worse. (Hidden in spoiler tag, it''s gruesome)\r\n\r\n[spoilers][center][img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/solidbatman/tumblr_m4myy9ykZI1r4xqamo1_500_zps9fbc6175.jpg[/img][/center][/spoilers]\r\n\r\nSoon, the characters begin to piece together what happened to them, and why the school is trying to kill them. Speaking of characters, the cast is very balanced. Some characters keep their cool, while others break down. That being said, some characters are very, very, sick people. One characters gets a high from seeing death, especially the death of children. Another character, as I''ve stated gropes, and plays with the entrails of corpses while photographing them. On the flip side, we have some noble characters who realize their short comings, or try to help others, but they are overshadowed by the twisted reality that they are in. \r\n\r\nPlenty of plot twists take place throughout the game and the ending, no matter what, is dark. Let that sink in.\r\n\r\n[center]There is no happy ending[/center]\r\n\r\nIf you want your stories and games to end on a happy note, do not play this game. The story in Corpse Party is a wonderfully twisted tale that pulls no punches. For the final two chapters, I was simply glued to my PSP. The story hooks you in, and drags you into a bloody, gore filled mess. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/solidbatman/d2f5e666f5c478b609e46a18cab58312b87454b2jpg__620x355_q85_crop_upscale_zpsc6a82b42.jpeg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nCorpse Party is one of the more memorable games I have played. Using incredible sound and bloody deaths, you will be hard pressed to make it out of Heavenly Host alive.

I apologize for that, I was in a rush to get back to the hospital with my family and I had to beat lunch traffic, so there was that. Anyway, I''m down in the cafe for a minute so I can talk now. The main thing new is that the site is no longer just a forum - it is now a full-fledged, interactive web site of innovative gaming information. While we would like to provide as much user content as possible, please understand that we are short-staffed, and only staff and admins can add and edit pages and games. Halo 4 has been submitted already with every achievement available to read up on. Soon enough (hopefully early next year) we''ll be able to provide achievement videos for you, via our YouTube Channel, [link=http://www.youtube.com/user/LostAchievements]Lost Achievements[/link].\n\nAs for the other admins are various, site faculty members, please don''t hesitate to start adding games to pages, as well as making articles, reviews, gaming information pages, tips & tricks pages, etc. I will be able to help out shortly, but right now I have a lot of really, really important and life-changing stuff going on, so I hope you don''t mind starting without me. That''s one reason I released everything early: I wanted to make up for the slowness around here, at least some what. \n\nAs I said yesterday, the rest of the remodel will be released in bits and pieces. This is not finished by a long-shot. I understand it''s gonna take a little while to get used to a lot of this, it''s a lot to take in. Kinda surprised Mike, actually. If there''s anything you don''t like, let me know. Yes I worked very hard on this, but I need to focus on what the user (you) likes. \n\nThere have just been a lot of updates and improvements, mainly to the home page but I will be getting to the forums shortly. They are going to be very largely updated. As you can see, I''m not quite done with a lot of it. There''s bits and pieces of things here and there if you sit there and try to play with some of it. Again, let me know something and we''ll talk about it.\n\nI hope you guys like this so far, though. I''m sorry things are going kinda strange and slow right now, I''m just not real sure where my head''s at and I got a lot of things going on. But yeah, thank you for understanding. I hope things can go back to normal soon enough, and if not then either way I''ll still work on this place in my free time because it''s the only real distraction I have.\n\n-- Alpha[br][hr]This post was automatically made when the update was posted.

(1393, 'Xenosaga Episode II: Jenseits von Gut und Bose [PS2]', '[center][img]http://ps2media.ign.com/ps2/image/object/545/545819/xenosaga2_ps2box_usa_org_000boxart_160w.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[b][i]Note: I never wrote a review for Episode One. If you are curious about Episode One, please click [url=http://gamefreaks11.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=ps2gr&action=display&thread=48]here[/url] for Game Freaks review.[/i][/b]\r\n\r\nVisuals - 8.5/10\r\nAfter playing the first game, I was quite disappointed with how the second game looked. The game did receive an upgrade in graphics, but to me, this is undermined by the radical changes in character designs. In fact, Shion received such a radical change in design (no doubt an attempt to please male gamers) that is difficult for me to recognize her in some scenes. I can understand trying to make the characters look more realistic, but it should not have been done at the cost of the original character designs.  Still, to be honest, this is all personal feeling and it does not affect the score I give it much. What keeps this score from being higher is the uninspired enemy designs.  Gone is the diverse range of enemies Episode I offered. Instead, you will fight the same enemies, with different stats. The wide use of coloring is also gone as everything has a bland tone to it. Other than these gripes, the game looks good and some parts look great, notably the awakening of Proto- Omega.\r\n\r\n[img]http://ps2media.gamespy.com/ps2/image/article/583/583059/xenosagaii_2_1106811526.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nSound - 5/10\r\nCharacter designs were not the only thing that Namco changed. The voice acting also saw a change as new actors were brought in. Shion, KOS- MOS, chaos, and MOMO all got new voice actors. In some cases, it worked, such as chaos and MOMO. In other cases, it failed horribly, as with Shion and KOS- MOS. KOS- MOS, a battle android, sounds like a human now as compared to her robotic sounding voice in Episode I, and Shion?s voice has changed to a less dramatic voice. She fails to convey any emotion other than anger it sounds like. The music in this game also takes a hit. Episode I featured a classical soundtrack while most of Episode II features a pop/techno soundtrack. Perhaps if Episode I hadn?t used a classical track, the pop/techno track could have worked, but the new soundtrack is annoying and doesn?t fit the feel of the series.\r\n\r\nGameplay - 6/10\r\nI feel like Namco told itself, ?If it ain?t broke, we?ll break it.? They do a great job of this in the gameplay aspect. The battle system takes getting used to with a new zone based system. Basically, every enemy (all 4 of them it feels like) has a weak zone. Some have a BB zone break, while others may have a CB or BC zone break. Your attack buttons correspond with the zones. Triangle is your C attack and square is your B attack. Enter the correct combination and you will break the enemy?s zone and do significantly more damage than you would have otherwise. After the enemy is broken, you can knock them into the air or onto the ground and increase your damage even more. You can stock your character up to three times, and this will allow your character to attack up to six times in one turn. If everything is timed correctly, you can win battles quite easily.  I actually liked this new system, but it?s broken by the nightmare known as boost. Every attack adds to your boost gauge, which allows you to boost a character, whose turn is later, to attack the next turn. It?s essentially the same as Episode I with one exception, the ease of boosting. Getting 3 boosts (the max limit) is way too easy for you and the enemy. This contributes to the mess that can happen in any given random fight. Sometimes you can kill the enemy without letting them make one move. Other times, the enemy will seriously hurt your party and inventory using the boost system.  I sometimes found myself having to replay portions of the game because and enemy was forcing me to use all of my items to just stay alive. Maybe if I could buy items with money, but wait! Namco, for some reason that will never satisfy me, decided to get rid of shops and money. So the only way to get items in this game is to defeat enemies, which can easily suck away your inventory by abusing the boost system. Boss battles also are annoying. In the early boss battles, there is one way to defeat the boss and if you fail to find out the proper way, you?re dead. There is too much emphasis on timing. If attacks are timed incorrectly in boss battles, forget being able to win that fight. Another issue I have with the gameplay is the leveling up. Everyone can learn every skill now. Instead of having a unique tree to follow, all of your characters can learn the same skills. While this can be seen as a good thing because of customization, I see it as a bad thing. Unless you constantly level up every character and always fight just for levels, characters just won?t get enough skill points for you to be able to give them new skills. You may have three characters that have unique high level skills, but the rest of your party will have low level base skills. The AGWS from Episode I also make a return as ES Machines or AMWS. These machines now have a use. Some battles have to be fought with ES Machines and you don?t have a choice in the matter. This isn?t a bad thing at all and I actually found the battle system for machines to be quite enjoyable. So, to sum it up, a collection of little bad things add up to one frustrating experience in the gameplay department.\r\n\r\nStory - 7/10\r\nThe story is perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the game. Episode I did a great job of focusing on everyone?s (minus chaos) story while Episode II is focused on Albedo, Negrido, and Rubedo. This is not a bad thing but it left me wanting a bit more in the other characters stories.  Luckily, there is a third game for this to happen in. Pretty much, Xenosaga Episode II picks up right where Episode I left off. The game opens up with a prologue that places chaos and a Realian named Canaan in the middle of the Miltian Conflict in which the song of Nephalim was played and the Gnosis first appeared 14 years before the events of Episode I. After the prologue is over, the attention shifts back to the present where the party is on the bridge of the Elsa after completing their mission inside Proto- Merkabah. MOMO is to go to 2nd Militia for a dive into her sub conscious to retrieve the Y- Data, the information left behind by the supposed architect of the Miltian Conflict. Albedo is also trying to unlock that information so he can open the closed gate to Militia and link with U- DO, a mysterious life form that awoke 14 years prior. Things go wrong very quickly as Albedo springs a trap to gain the Y- Data. Many new factions are introduced as well in the game. The story, as it does in most sequels, does not live up to its predecessor?s story. The pace is slower and it feels like that much of the story is just filler. This can be backed up by boss battles. In Episode I, the bosses had stories and motives for stopping. They weren?t just there to be a boss battle. In Episode II, the boss battles, at least until the end, feel like they are just there to be a boss battle. Most of the bosses have little to no story behind them and that hurts the story telling in this game. The whole Ormus Stronghold dungeon serves absolutely no purpose in advancing the story at all. It?s as if the developers noticed the game would be too short and just added a dungeon to add time to the game. Again, I?m going to pick on Shion. Her attitude changes completely from the first game to this one.  She was a kind, caring person but in Episode II, she comes across as mean and, well, a word that would violate the rules of this forum. chaos also changes from a cheerful character to a dark sad sounding character. This wouldn?t be an issue if there was a long period of time between the two games, but there isn?t. The second game occurs right after the first.\r\n\r\nOverall - 7/10\r\nThe only reason I managed to finish this game is the simple fact that I wanted to know what happened next. The game is full of filler, sub par storytelling (for this series), bad voice acting, and poorly designed game play. Too much change can be a bad thing and this game proves it. I don?t want you to think this game is terrible. Compared to the first game, it certainly is a step backwards, but compared to most games, this game still stands up as just as good if not better. Maybe my expectations were too high going into this game, but I feel justified with those expectations after playing the incredible first entry in to the series. I only recommend this game if you played the first game and liked it enough that you want to see what happens next.', 1393, 16, '2012-12-04 02:43:10', 46, 'no', ':16:2:1:2:2:2:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:55', 'Part 2 of the Xenosaga Epic', '2012-12-04 02:43:10', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 70, '', '', 'no', '', '', ''),

(1432, 'Looking for a shooter...', 'Alright, so i am looking for a new shooter game. Requirements? Be like Halo <single player> and not be open world.\r\n\r\n[b]TL;DR is at  the bottom if you don want to read all of this. [/b]\r\n\r\nSo what do i mean by "Be like Halo?" Have kick ass storyline? Likeable characters? Be a science fantasy shooter? Those are awesome ideas...but not specifically, but those will help big time. What i am looking for is a shooter game with the same gameplay as Halo. \r\n\r\nPeople say Halo is an arcade -like game with a linear gameplay. Wrong! Looking for another game that allows me to play the level the way i see fit. \r\n\r\n-Should I bombard everything the whole way to the ending fighting vehicles and foot soldiers alike? \r\n-Or perhaps go recon and snipe my way and try to avoid the necessary firefights? \r\n-Actually, i feel like driving a vehicle with a mounted turret, give my passenger soldier a rocket launcher and rain hell at my enemies. \r\n-Dang it! a plasma grenade struck my car and killed everyone but me. Surrounded by 5 enemy vehicles and a dozen or so foot soldiers. I am alone. Ill just hijack an enemy vehicle, kick the driver off, and use their vehicle to kill their guys. That''ll work\r\n\r\nSee what i mean? Minus a few key firefights, you have total control on how to do things. Tactics play a heavy role in the game. Your friendly AIs are not perfect, but the best ones in any shooter i have ever played. You actually feel it when one of them dies...things get a bit harder. And if you want to get into a vehicle, and only 1 guy survives out of a group of 10, then you will not be able to have someone rain rocket fire upon your enemies. Things become a bit harder. \r\n\r\nSo i want a game like that for the PS3. Any games out there?\r\n\r\nSo let your imaginations soar!\r\n\r\n[b]TL;DR Too bad too sad. scroll back up and read the god damned thing.

(1483, 'Looking Back: Xenosaga Part I', '[i]Welcome to Looking Back. In this semi regular post, I plan on simply writing about past experiences that I''ve had in gaming, basically telling my gaming story. Hopefully you find this interesting and maybe I''ll introduce you guys to different games and genres you may not have been interested in before.[/i]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i1309.photobucket.com/albums/s639/gamefreaks11/gamez/_banner32-53969-full.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nXenosaga is a series of 3 games released by Namco Bandai (the folks behind .dot//Hack, Tekken, and the upcoming PS3 exclusive, Ni No Kuni) that tells the story of a universe some 2000 years in the future. Developed by Monolith Soft as the spiritual sequel/prequel to the cult hit, Xenogears, Xenosaga features a complex story line, interesting characters, and enough religious symbolism to make conservative gamers tremble. The game is full of secret bosses, plenty of side stories, mini- games, and above all, a great cast with some incredible villains. A case could be made that the first episode of Xenosaga was so ambitious and well done, that it killed the series. I''ll explain more of that in a bit. Now that you have a basic understanding of what Xenosaga is, let''s get a quick story crash course for you folks.\r\n\r\nXenosaga Episode I: Dur Wille zur Macht (The Will to Rule) opens up on present day Earth. An archaeological team is digging for something, when they find a strange object. The object has a small insertion for a sort of key. The man heading up the project just so happens to have the key and places it in the slot. Light shoots across the ground and a mysterious object rises from the ocean. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i1309.photobucket.com/albums/s639/gamefreaks11/gamez/xenosaga-episode-I-der-wille-zur-macht-4.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nFast forward 2000 years, humanity has explored the galaxy, developing a UMN Network to allow gate jumps for fast travel to various worlds. This UMN is run by the giant Vector Corporation. A fleet of Galactic Federation ships is carrying valuable cargo across space, namely the mysterious object from the beginning of the game. This object is called the Zohar and for some reason attracts an alien being known as the Gnosis. The Gnosis are basically invulnerable to attack as they do not exist on the same plain in the universe as humanity does (think a different dimension). For that reason, these government ships carry a top secret weapon being developed and tested by Vector, the KOS-MOS project. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i1309.photobucket.com/albums/s639/gamefreaks11/gamez/kosmos610.jpg[/img]\r\n[i]Weaponry has never looked so good[/i][/center]\r\n\r\nKOS-MOS is a battle android capable of fighting the Gnosis by bringing them into our dimension making them bleed like the rest of us. Shion Uzuki is the Chief Director of Vector'' 1st R&D Division, making her the lead of the KOS-MOS project. With the military pressing her for activation tests, Shion is very reluctant to comply and hopes she never has to activate KOS-MOS. Things quickly go downhill when the Gnosis show up and KOS-MOS automatically activates bypassing all fail safes. This is how the grand, epic tale of Xenosaga begins.\r\n\r\nSo did that seem confusing? Don''t worry, that very brief introduction is the only simple thing about this story. What makes this story so great is it''s detail. A massive encyclopedia is included in game for explanations and back story if you ever want to know more. Huge corporations attempt to balance themselves between governments, religious fanatics fight for their beliefs, alien attacks continue to weaken humanity, and science is in the business of creating God. All of this is going on in the background, affecting your journey to simply survive. After the first game, your goal becomes much larger as the villains goals come to light. \r\n\r\nNow, why do I love it? It''s the way the story progresses. There is never that one big twist that many RPGs use. It''s a collection of a bunch of small, little twists that keep the story fresh and interesting. Xenosaga Episode I stays fresh during the entire 30+ hour journey. Whether it be government betrayal, religious crusades, or the mystery surrounding Earth and Milita (a planet) fates, there is always something to ponder. Which brings me to my next point about the game.\r\n\r\nA great story can only carry a game so far. You need great characters in the story to push it along. Xenosaga Episode I introduces a ton of incredible characters. We get the strange boy in chaos (lowercase c) who seems to save the day and know more about KOS-MOS than he should, the religious fanatic Margulis who acts as the military leader for U-Tic (a religious organization), Albedo, the crazy laughing maniac who cuts off his own head to scare a little Realian (artificial human), and KOS-MOS, the battle android who for some reason has a will of her own. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i1309.photobucket.com/albums/s639/gamefreaks11/gamez/1347294-gg_790screen037_super.jpg[/img]\r\n[i]Albedo being Albedo[/i][/center]\r\n\r\nOver the course of the first game we learn a lot about these characters, but end up with more questions than answers. I was on the edge of my seat trying to piece together the giant jigsaw puzzle of a story and how the characters fit in to everything for the duration of the first game. It captured me, and had me reading every encyclopedia article in the game. I had to know more. As a history buff, Xenosaga''s lore was my newest fixation. Great story aside, Xenosaga also had to do something else to keep me playing instead of looking up the story online. That something is gameplay.\r\n\r\nXenosaga Episode I features your typical Turn Based battles. You have two rows to use four characters with. Placement is key since back row characters do less damage, but also take less damage. Front row character are the opposite. So it comes as no surprise that correct placement of your party can make or break battles for you. Another key part of battles is the Boost system. Lets say you use a physical attack. If you have enough Action Points (the points that allow you to attack) saved up and the ticker at the bottom of the screen is on a physical icon, you can boost into an extra turn. This allows you to string multiple attacks together doing more damage. However, the enemy can boost too, so you have to plan when to use your boost and how to use it. If you aren''t the battle type, you''re in luck. There are no random battles. Enemies walk around on screen and only engage in battle if they touch you. Obviously you want to fight to gain experience to level up, or bosses will annihilate you.\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i1309.photobucket.com/albums/s639/gamefreaks11/gamez/xenosaga1a.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nAs you level up, you can add new attacks to your arsenal and create specialized party members. For example, KOS-MOS was my main attacker. She was leveled in a way to allow for her to deal a ton of damage and a solid amount. Shion was a support attacker. She could heal and buff, but also deal some damage. On the flip side, she could not take much damage. \r\n\r\nYou get to choose how to fight your battles and the battles feel fair. I never found myself thinking, "Well that was dumb" or "Bullcrap!" during battles. Everything about them is designed well. The battle system is very easy to learn and some complain that it is shallow. I personally love it because it is simple. It lets the story do all the strange and new things while it acts as a constant. It does not take the focus away from where it should be, the story and characters.\r\n\r\nAs I''ve stated before, Xenosaga Episode I leaves you with more questions than answers and wanting even more story. Luckily there exists something out there to give you hope for answers. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i1309.photobucket.com/albums/s639/gamefreaks11/gamez/xstitlelogo027eg.jpg[/img]\r\n[i]Unfortunately, it also disappoints[/i] [/center]\r\n\r\n[i][b]To be continued...[/b][/i]', 1483, 16, '2012-12-17 18:48:17', 46, 'no', ':16:34:1:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:2:1:1:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:55', 'N/A', '2012-12-17 18:48:17', 0, 0, 0, 0, 16, 97, '', '', 'no', '', '', ''),

(1495, 'Re: Violent Videogames and their effects', 'That was a good video and puts to rest some theories on video games. Do I think video games are too violent? Yeah I sort of do. For example, when you see a game advertised, unless it''s an indie game, its always the violence and action that is publicized. Borderlands 2 advertised its bazillion guns, Black Ops 2 advertised ways to kill people in multiplayer, Fallout 3 and New Vegas advertised the ability to choose which body parts of enemies to blow off, and Assassins Creed advertises ways to assassinate. \r\nBut why do publishers advertise that? Why not advertise the story of the game, or the graphics of the game? Violence sells. Humans love violence. From the Romans gladiatorial matches, to dog fighting and wrestling, through out history, we found ways to enjoy violence. I''m not a scientist or neurologist so I cant tell you why we love violence, but just a quick look back at history is pretty damning evidence that we do love it.\r\nVideo games are simply something that opponents of the medium don''t understand. Violent movies were blamed for ills in the world, rock music too, and television. Anything that a generation just doesn''t understand, is deemed as evil and brainwashing. It''s just how it is. People blame what they don''t get. It''s easier to blame what you don''t get because you can place what ever ideals you have into your argument, as Jack Thompson does. A case could be made that video games are the cause in the decrease of violent crime. It is something for people to take out aggression in. When I''m mad about work or something, I''ll more than likely seek to play a few rounds of Battlefield 3 to calm down. My aggression and anger is redirected away from other people and instead on faceless enemies. It could very well be that way for others.\r\n\r\nMy final thoughts on this issue is that ultimately, the burden is on parents to decide what is right and wrong for their children. These kids don''t buy the games themselves. They either bought it with allowance money from their parents or got their parents to buy it for them. The ESRB, while is weird about the sex-violence ratio (Hyperdimension Neptunia mk.2 got an M for suggestive dialogue, and the tentacle bondage thing) it does tell you right on the back what is in the game, down to tobacco usage. Parents need to use this. If the game says Blood and Gore and is rated M, well maybe 7 year old little Timmy doesn''t need to play it. Just as a preant wouldn''t allow their kid to drive before 16, maybe parents need to not allow their kid to play a rated M game until they are older.\r\n', 1488, 16, '2012-12-20 21:13:13', 46, 'yes', '', '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 'no', '', '', ''),

The first half of the movie is filled with action scenes, all of which or done incredibly well. EVA Unit 2 also has a brilliantly choreographed fight scene in this film that really sets the tone for the first half of the film. The art work is a lot smoother than the original series in my eyes and doesn''t feel as lazy or budgeted... for the first half of the film. \r\n\r\nThe second half of EoE is a whole different story. Surreal is the best way to describe it, but also lazy. We see plenty of re-used scenes, not to the scale of episodes 25 and 26 of the series, but it is still rather annoying. Back to the surrealism though, I had a problem with a lot of it for the simple fact that it was there for no reason it felt like. Obviously, NGE was not grounded in realism at all, but it becomes incredibly over the top in the latter half of the film. Things appear as convenient plot devices, still frames occur, and one of my biggest gripes in anime and gaming, live action scenes are used. But for all my complaints, EoE is still extremely interesting to watch because of all the surrealism.\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i2.listal.com/image/1578580/600full-neon-genesis-evangelion%3A-the-end-of-evangelion-screenshot.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h204/jedinewtype/vlcsnap-704103.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n-Characters- 6/10\r\nNot much has changed when it comes to the characters. In fact, nothing has changed. We do see Langley''s redemption of character, at least in my eyes. She becomes a strong lead after becoming one of my least favorite characters towards the end of the series. Shinji is, of course, still Shinji and some of the choices he makes completes his journey to becoming an utterly despicable and angst filled character. His character alone, makes this movie frustrating to watch at times. The sheer apathy he displays is something to behold. Unfortunately, the viewer is forced to put up with 90 minutes of Shinji. Rei, well I can''t honestly say I understand her. As for the other characters, we really are not treated to anything new or given any scenes of character growth.\r\n\r\n-Story- 9/10\r\n[b]SPOILERS FOR NGE AHEAD[/b]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://3.ff-cover.com/video/9688/0_s/00000006.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe final angel has been defeated and NERVs mission appears to be over. SEELE though has plans for NERV, the EVA units, and all of humanity, and launches an attack on NERV to kill those working for NERV that could get in the way of their plans. This includes the children who pilot the EVA units and their commanders. For unknown reasons, that are made clear later (unlike many other things), Gendo and SEELE both wish to begin the Third Impact, and Rei is the key to beginning it.\r\n\r\nThat is simply the best way this film can be summed up. It will more than likely take 2 or 3 viewings to fully understand the main themes of the movie, and you may never understand many of the smaller things. The story moves along at a great pace for the first 45 minutes and things do make sense for the most part. The latter half, though, is left up to interpretation. Different people will get different ideas about what went on. In a sense, that is how the entire series was.\r\n\r\n-Overall- 8/10\r\nThe End of Evangelion is a good film that will affect people very differently. There are many interpretations of the film and each viewer will more than likely take something different out of it, aside from the thought of "What did I just watch?" For all of it''s short comings, EoE is an enjoyable, thought provoking film that will exercise your brain and leave you wanting for more answers.

As for the atmosphere of the game, great care was taken in making this zombie infested world look bleak and depressing. The player gets a sense of just how hopeless these characters are at times in large part because of the visuals. Muted browns are used heavily, calling back to the TV series, which uses the same style of coloring. As for the zombies, they look like zombies, though they too look like plastic models. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i1309.photobucket.com/albums/s639/gamefreaks11/gamez/ps3/ps3%20completed/the-walking-dead-episode-4.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n[center][i]Get used to dealing with zombies'' appetites[/i][/center]\r\n\r\n-Sound- 8.5/10\r\n\r\nWhile the voice acting has a couple of rough patches, everyone turns in solid performances with their acting. Lee and Clementine are voiced wonderfully and do a great job a portraying their emotions. Everyone else turned in good work, but Lee and Clem really stood out. The music, too, is well done. The use of somber stringed instruments was a great choice because it helps convey the atmosphere to the player. In another great choice, the developers went for a more minimal approach to the music, so in many cases, there simply won''t be music. It makes the player feel alone and helpless in the game.\r\n\r\n-Gameplay- 7/10\r\n\r\nThis is The Walking Dead''s stumbling block. The gameplay is mainly dialogue and puzzle driven. During most conversations, dialogue choices will pop up for you to choose, like in Mass Effect or Fallout. A key difference from those two games though, is the time limit. You can''t sit there and ponder each choice. If time runs out before you pick a choice, Lee will just stay silent, and the characters will react to that. Nearly everything you say is remembered by characters and the way they treat you, or act around you is based off what you say and do. Your choices won''t affect the ultimate out come of the game, but how you get there is basically left totally up to you, the player.\r\n\r\nThe other key part is the puzzle game play. It''s usually just as simple as inspect the objects and find something to open a door or get into a building. The puzzles are never hard and usually have no consequence for taking a while. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i1309.photobucket.com/albums/s639/gamefreaks11/gamez/ps3/ps3%20completed/TheWalkingDeadGame-600x300.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nWhere the gameplay stumbles is in its actions sequences. All actions are done by using the left joystick to move a cursor over your target, and pressing X to interact. It proves to be very cumbersome and inaccurate, especially when time matter, such as when a friend is being dragged around by zombies. You may move the cursor too far, which is very easy to do, or be unable to keep the cursor over the target as it is moving and wriggling around. It''s just poorly executed. The only way I ever died was in these sequences when I couldn''t get the cursor over my target fast enough. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i1309.photobucket.com/albums/s639/gamefreaks11/gamez/ps3/ps3%20completed/326638.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n-Story- 9/10\r\n\r\nYou play as Lee Evertt, a convicted killer being escorted to prison outside of Atlanta. While having a conversation with the police officer transporting you, the police car hits a zombie and swerves off the road into the woods. Lee manages to escape, taking out a zombie, or a walker, thanks to some help. Slightly injured, Lee seeks out help in a nearby house. It''s here that he meets Clementine, a young girl who has been left alone. Together they try to find her parents and survive the zombie outbreak.\r\n\r\nFans of the television series and the comic series will be right at home with this game. The focus of the story isn''t really the zombies themselves, but the characters. We never find out what caused the outbreak, and we are instead treated to different reactions to it and different ideas on how to survive. Is it survival of the fittest? Should we try and help everyone? How are we going to get food? The story is well written and has plenty of twists and turns. As I said earlier, the ending is basically the same for everyone, but the details and how you get there is almost entirely left up to you.\r\n\r\n-Overall- 8.5/10\r\n\r\nThe Walking Dead is certainly a game you should play if you favor story over gameplay. It creates a compelling narrative that draws the player in completely. It has been a while since I have been so invested in a story and it''s characters within a video game. A good number of glitches occur, and some poorly designed action sequences making The Walking Dead short of amazing. It is, however, a great game and one almost all fans of the zombie genre should play.', 1524, 16, '2013-01-01 05:19:44', 46, 'no', ':16:9:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:34:1:1:1:1:55', 'A wild review appears.

I have to say I love it very, very much. But soon, everything changes. At least, eventually. Fun things, happy things, they will all change some day, you know. But, can you still love this place?" -Nagisa Furukawa[/i][/center]\r\n\r\nIf you are a fan of anime, there is little doubt that you have heard of a Kyoto Animation work called Clannad and Clannad ~After Story~. What you may not know is that those two shows are an adaptation of prolific visual novel maker Key. \r\n\r\nFor those new to the genre, a visual novel is less of a game, and more of a choose your own adventure book. They are not very popular in the west, but have a solid following in Japan. Despite the fact that they lack a large following in the west, many games you play contain elements of visual novel game play. If you have ever played Mass Effect, Fallout, Elder Scrolls, Dragon Age, Deus Ex, or the more recent Persona titles, you have played a game with elements of the visual novel genre. In those games I listed, you are often given dialogue choices that will shape the story. Now imagine a game where that is all you do. You watch the story unfold, and pick dialogue choices to guide it how you want to. \r\n\r\nThat is what a visual novel is. There is usually little, to no game play allowing the writers and developers to focus solely on story. For that reason, playing a visual novel is more like reading a book than playing a game. Because it resembles reading more than gaming, many western gamers are turned off by the genre. Another contributing factor to the lack of popularity is the prevalent use of sex scenes and perverted stories in the genre. Luckily, there are many visual novels that do not feature these sort of things, instead choosing to focus on creating a great, powerful story instead of using sex to sell the novel. Clannad is one such novel.\r\n\r\nClannad opens up in a dream like world where everything appears to be covered in snow. This world is called the Illusionary World. There is no life in this world, save for one young girl who creates a body out of junk for the player to inhabit. The story quickly shifts to the real world again. \r\n\r\nYou assume the role of Tomoya Okazaki, a student at Hikarizara Private High School. In junior high, he were a good basketball player, until a fight with your father ruined his shoulder. Unable to play basketball, and alienated from his father, Tomoya becomes a tardy student, showing up late to class and not trying in the classes he does show up to. He spends most of his time at  Youhei Sunohara''s dormitory. Sunohara is also a delinquent as well after a falling out with the soccer team. Together, the two scrape by in school, never trying to better themselves or plan for the future.\r\n\r\nOne day, while late for school, Tomoya comes across a girl who wears the same uniform as him. She is standing at the bottom of the hill leading to the school trying to motivate herself to go. Together, Tomoya and the girl, who we find later is named Nagisa Furukawa, walk to school together. From here, the story branches out into many different directions, or routes. \r\n\r\nFor example, you can choose to hang out with Nagisa, or visit the library which will introduce you to another girl whose story you can follow. That being said, Nagisa is the main heroine in Clannad and she is a main character in more than just her route. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/solidbatman/33811c6a-f4dc-4cef-afd2-c3d4bf615afb_zps3ceb5596.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n[center][i]Nagisa Furukawa[/i][/center]\r\n\r\nClannad''s main theme, through nearly all of the routes, is the importance of family. Nearly all of the routes involve a family member of the main protagonist. For example, the twin sisters, Kyou and Ryou Fujibayishi''s routes are intertwined with each other. Nagisa''s route offers a stark contrast in families compared to Tomoya''s family. Fuko Ibuki''s route is centered around her older sister. Families shape our lives, and make us who we are, and Clannad does a great job of showing this to the reader. \r\n\r\nA key to having a good VN, is having a good character for the player to play as. Tomoya fills that role very well. He is a smart ass, has a "filthy" mouth, and is "rude", but is selfless and very loyal to his friends. Despite this, he does portray a few flaws since he is somewhat hot headed and a couple of things in After Story left me not liking him. He seems to find a way to redeem himself after his stumblings, thanks in large part to his family. \r\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is well written too. Kyou is brash, loud, and quick to anger often flinging a dictionary as a weapon. She mirrors Tomoya in many ways as she does show a softer side with how she treats her twin sister, Ryou, and her pet, Botan. Fuko is just hilarious with her love of star fish and her suspicion that Tomoya is, in fact, "a strange person". Kotomi, the genius, is very innocent and harbors an almost obsessive fear of bullies. Those are but a few of the colorful personalities you will come across while reading Clannad. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/solidbatman/0057_595_zpscefa271e.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n[center][i]Kyou and Ryou[/i][/center]\r\n\r\nDespite all of them, the main story belongs to Nagisa, who luckily for us, manages to border the cute, but not too cute line. She loves Dango (pictured below), but has very little self-confidence. Her interactions with Tomoya vary from sweet and cute, to dark and serious, all without making the reader think she is bi-polar. In that sense, she feels real. She may act childish, but she is in fact really mature, and simply insecure, usually fearing the worst. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/solidbatman/001ffc00-46a4-4b0b-8f15-5b519833be92_zps568ff068.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n[center][i]A family of Dango (from the anime)[/i][/center]\r\n\r\nNearly all of the routes in the main part of the game are balanced very well with heavy doses of humor matched with strong drama. Sunohara is our comic relief, and his banter with Tomoya, and the girls from other routes usually had me laughing. For example, when a girl named Tomoyo beats up some biker gang punks, Sunohara refuses to believe a girl can be stronger than a guy, so he challanges Tomoyo to fights, or tries to get Tomoyo to admit she is a man. All of these end in amazing fashion, with Tomoyo setting new records for her kick combos. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/solidbatman/6a4a609c-eaf3-4941-a97a-9a97beb6e58a_zps6c16a123.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n[center][i]Sunohara gets a new name[/i][/center]\r\n\r\nWhile the comedy in Clannad is hilarious, the drama is what makes it a memorable experience. Many characters have experienced death and suffered emotional trauma in the past, or might be struggling to carve out a new identity. Kotomi''s route, and Fuko''s route stand out in the first part of Clannad as two of the strongest stories. Both deal with heavily with the family theme, and coping mechanisms to tragic events. I don''t want to go into too much detail, since it would spoil a lot, but the ending of most of the routes are very well done and bittersweet in many cases.\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/solidbatman/fukoprank1_zps01608148.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n[center][i]Let''s play a prank on Fuko[/i][/center]\r\n\r\nAll of what I''m mentioning now takes place in the first part of the game or what I like to call, the School Arc. Clannad is divided into two separate parts. The School Arc , and After Story. The School Arc certainly has some sad moments, as well as bittersweet moments. After Story tops that sadness. Taking place after Tomoya graduates, it follows the next 7 years of his life with Nagisa and his family. Family plays an even more important role in After Story as we learn more about Tomoya''s family, and we see how he would act in a family unit, something we dont see in the School Arc. \r\n\r\nWe also learn more about the Illusionary World and the two inhabitants of it. Throughout the School Arc, the story of the Illusionary World is advanced slowly, and in After Story, it finally plays a very important part of the story. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/solidbatman/0022_595_zps3ae78d79.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nWithout After Story, Clannad is a cute, bittersweet visual novel with some very good moments and a great story. With After Story, Clannad becomes something different. It becomes an experience. While games have made me feel sad, Clannad made me wake up the next day feeling depressed. After Story is depressing, but before you say "I don''t want to play a depressing game," there is hope. By completing all the different routes, and obtaining objects called Orbs of Light, you can change the ending. This "True Ending" is perfectly done, especially after seeing the regular After Story ending. My sadness over the ending was instantly washed away thanks to the True Ending. It really is that good.  \r\n\r\nWhile I have been praising Clannad this entire time, it does have a couple of flaws. One of them is something all visual novels share. Wrong Ends. If you pick incorrect choices in the dialogue, you may get bad endings, and miss out on the story. This can be remedied by having many saves (99 pages worth are allowed I think). The choices are not always clear cut. You may think you are doing the right thing, but you in fact did the wrong thing. I played for 3 hours at one point, only to end with a Wrong End. While Clannad gives you the option to skip text you have already seen (allowing you to reach the point you were at in no time at all), it can be frustrating for gamers used to the "Good Choice, Neutral Choice, Bad Choice" options of most dialogue, story driven video games.  \r\n\r\nAnother minor complaint involves the translation. Doki Fansubs is to be praised with the amount of effort they put into translating Clannad, but there are some major typos, errors, bugs, and just parts that are not translated. It does not break the game, nor does it hinder the story, but it does get annoying at times to be called "No valid string attached please make a ticket about it," by Nagisa when all she is saying is "Tomoya- kun". Other times, the translation is awkward, or too literal. Translating from Japanese to English is hard, I know. That being said, the Doki release (the only English release that I know of) could use some heavy editing and quality checks. Again, Doki Fansubs deserves a lot of praise for tackling something as large as Clannad, and it is a minor complaint. \r\n\r\nThe final complaint I have is the art style. It grows on you, but can be a bit jarring at first, especially if you are new to anime style art. There is nothing wrong with it except that is it moe (ultra cute style, big, innocent eyes). This moe style turns off many gamers from trying out eastern games. Please, do not let that sway your decision to play games, or read this visual novel. \r\n\r\nClannad is the fist long visual novel I have ever completed. I truly regret not playing it sooner because the story and characters far surpass anything I have seen in gaming in terms of growth, complexity, and how I am able to connect to them. I dare say Clannad is a masterpiece in both story telling and character development. You are doing yourself a disservice by not reading this visual novel.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Overall: [/u]10/10[/b]\r\n\r\nYou can download the game [url=http://fuwanovel.org/novels/16]here[/url].

(1674, 'The Dream and An Idea', 'The foundation of DreamSpand began with what everything else does: an idea. It was an idea that the community could break out, and make a huge difference not only in the gaming industry, but in shaping the careers of future programmers and developers. There are endless, well-paying possibilities in the gaming industry; there are no limits to what you''re able to do. DreamSpand aims to not only one day revolutionize gaming, but to inspire other people to follow their dreams and to have the biggest imagination possible. A lot of people tell us to get a life and live in the real world. What they don''t know is we''re gamers, so we have lots of lives, and that while they''re doomed to only one sad, broken world, we''ve expanded to endless realms of possibility and creation, somewhere that, most of the time, we don''t even have to get up to go to (which works well if you''re lazy, too). \r\n\r\nI''m not saying the real world doesn''t matter, because it does matter plenty, but I think a vast imagination and a powerful inspiration in your heart for your passion is how true success is reached, and if that passion is gaming, then game on. \r\n\r\nGuys, I know it doesn''t seem like it, but we''re doing okay. Not great, but okay. We have a community with a few people, very few, but they''re all great and they''re the backbone of the site. I haven''t been much of a leader lately and I''m going to attempt to correct that. We can be so much more if we actually just get out there and stick to it. Each of us have a purpose here, even if he or she doesn''t feel like they do, and yes, even the stupid robots:\r\n\r\nMe - I coded the site..it may not do too much right now (or it might do TOO many things), but I still built it from the ground up and I think, personally, that we''re going to be better because of it.\r\n\r\nMike - The site name is his and he''s my best friend, like a brother to me. I didn''t feel like going into the site business again alone because it left me so tattered last time when I did, but he reassured me and we run the place together. I don''t know where I''d be without the guy, he''s joined me on all the rest of my endeavors and I''m thankful to have him on this one.\r\n\r\nSam - The first regularly active member that actually found the site and started helping out at the old one..kinda gave us hope, really. Just a cool guy.\r\n\r\nsolidbatman - Provides gaming keys and such for contests and just as gifts (wouldn''t have Minecraft without the guy and wouldn''t be able to help with the server stuff on DreamSpand''s world.. which by the way is coming along nicely).\r\n\r\nvibrantblade - Funny dude, always amusing to watch him and solidbatman argue over something silly.\r\n\r\nSilvermist - My girlfriend and the support that keeps me going. She always thinks I''m the strong one, but I can''t be strong alone..and she posts on here a pretty good bit, keeps the place moderately active.\r\n\r\nThe point that I''m trying to make, guys, is that we''re not a dead community..we just haven''t been born yet. We''re still pushing our way through that primordial ooze, and yes, I will admit, I''m not a good site owner. A lot has changed since back in the day when I first did this and it''s not as easy as it used to be. There weren''t too many fancy things out there, so whoever had the slightest bit of shiny new stuff that flickered on and off were the ones that got the activity, which is why I''m so used to just adding features and updates, because that used to work, but it doesn''t operate on just that alone anymore and I''m having to adjust some things. My last communities were based on just one specific thing from a Sonic game called chao, and believe it or not, one of those communities is still flourishing even today. Mike created the DreamSpand foundation, I just gave it life and a body.. and it was built to be a general gaming site. I also think that''s one of the issues, too, is that with my last community, it was aimed at a younger audience as opposed to what this one seems to attract: matured people..for the most part. *looks over at GoogleBot*\r\n\r\nBut the point is that we CAN be somebody, we CAN rise up out of this setback. It''s just gonna take more than one of us to do it, and it can''t be just features or just content, it''s gotta be a whole bunch of things. We need something, anything, that sets us apart from everyone else. We''ve already got a Minecraft server in construction, so that definitely makes us at least a [i]little[/i] unique, since the community will have a metaphysical aspect to it. But we''re gonna need something more, and yes, it''s a lot of work to get this place going, which is why I understand that some of you can''t jump on this, even if you would like to. I can''t do too much right now either due to finals and essays coming up in a week or two at college, myself. I''m just saying, that if we want this to work, then we just need more than one or two of us participating..we need to actually try..and most of you are. I''m thankful for that. \r\n\r\nSo let''s get out there and make the world know that we''re the next generation of possibility.

(1682, 'Re: Playstation 4 Announced: Round Up', 'I think Sony is holding off showing the console until E3. The fact that people will be talking about it until then is a good thing for Sony since it builds up hype for the PS4. Sony as a company needs the PS4 to succeed as they are losing a ton of money in other divisions, such as the TV division with the failed PS branded 3DTV.  \r\n\r\nI see this as an opportunity for Japanese developers to step it up. You are right, Sony didn''t show off anything that wowed me game-wise, and I was praying Square Enix would show us something. E3 this year is going to be huge for game announcements though. I bet we won''t really see anything for the new Xbox until E3 game-wise as well. \r\n\r\nUltimately, gaming consoles cannot survive as simply a gaming console anymore, and I think we are going to see that with the Wii U. Handhelds will always be popular, but consoles are going to have to become an all-in-one entertainment center. I think we saw the shift this generation with Microsoft integrating more apps into the Xbox. Sony seems to be really pushing the social networking and apps in the hopes of bringing in a larger user base. I think they realize being the "hardcore" system won''t work anymore. Heck, the game they lead off with, Knack, was a happier, Pixar looking game. That right there leads me to believe that Sony is retooling to combat Nintendo and smart phones, as we also heard a lot about streaming to phones and tablets. \r\n\r\nNow, whether or not Sony can keep the exclusives is another question. We saw 3 confirmed exclusives and all are from first/second party developers. Sony has had Atlus for a long time, and what Atlus decides to do with Persona 5 will indicate if Sony keeps solid exclusive third party support (They lost Insomniac last year, who was a Sony mainstay).

If Sony dropped the price now, or at E3, then they would be hurting sales of the PS4. I think the average consumer, if they are paying $250 (I think thats the PS3 price point), wouldn''t mind paying an extra $100 or so to get a PS4 instead which is 7 years newer and has more features. But if you drop the PS3 price to $199 or something low like that, then no one will even give the PS4 a look.

Instead of the conditional turn base system in [url=http://gamefreaks11.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=ps2gr&action=display&thread=34]Final Fantasy X[/url], there is now an bar that charges for you attacks. This is called the Active Time Bar or ATB. Certain attacks will cause the bar to take longer to refill. Stringing together multiple attacks using your party will cause it to charge faster allowing you to attack at a quicker pace. Only drawback to this new system, you have to be fast and quick in strategical thinking.\r\n In X-2, the leveling up system has changed from [url=http://gamefreaks11.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=ps2gr&action=display&thread=34]FFX[/url]. Instead of a sphere grid, there is now something called dress spheres. These spheres you find around Spira contain unique abilities. One sphre you can find contains black mage abilities. Another called warrior has sword fighting abilities. As you complete missions, you find more spheres and garment grids. Garment grids are what you put the sphere in. They may contain four slots which means four dress spheres can be equipped. Other grids may have five slots meaning five spheres can be used. You then equip the grid to one of your characters and that character can switch between the equipped dress spheres. Certain garment grids come with special abilities as well. Some raise attack or defense. Others allow you to cast spells or be immune from certain attacks. \r\nIn X-2, you can advance the story at your own pace. You travel all across Spira on an air ship. In the navigation menu, story advancement areas are labeled as hot spots. This allows you to do side missions before advancing past them in the story accidentally. There are plenty of side missions to do and the amount of mini games seem endless. You will have a hard time running out of things to do.\r\n\r\n-Story- 9/10\r\nSin has been defeated and Spira is at peace, sort of. Two rival groups have formed: New Yevon and the Youth League. Both groups are competing to find spheres, video recordings of Spira''s past, and they have divided Spira. Some people follow New Yevon while others, still understandably sore about Yevon and Sin, follow the Youth League. Yuna has joined a sphere hunting group called the Gullwings. In this group Yuna is joined by FFX characters such as Rikku and Brother as well as new comers such as Paine and Shrina. Your adventure kicks off when Rikku finds a sphere that has a recording of someone closely resembling Tidus. He looks to be captured and is yelling at an unknown person. Yuna wants to find more spheres to find out if this person is really Tidus.

I don''t want to know...what is real!"[/i][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\nEver17: The Out of Infinity is a visual novel made produced by KID that originally was released in 2002 for the Playstation 2 and Sega Dreamcast. In 2003, KID released the novel on PC and Hirameki International brought the game to the United States 2 years later. Thank goodness they did.\r\n\r\nEver17 is part of a larger series called the Infinity series. Other novels in the series include, Never7: The End of Infinity, Remember11: The Age of Infinity,  12Riven &#8213;the &#936;climinal of integral&#8213;, and Code_18 (Code_18 was not made by KID, nor written by any of the KID staff.). The series is made up of separate stories with recurring themes and theories. Of the entire Infinity series, Ever17 is the only one that ever made it over seas to the United States, though fan translations exist for Never7, and Remember11. 12Riven is also currently being translated.\r\n\r\nNow that this brief background is out of the way, let''s get into Ever17: The Out of Infinity. Ever17 is a visual novel. If you read my [url=http://gamefreaks11.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=mississippi&action=display&thread=622&page=1]Clannad[/url] review, then you already have a general idea of how a VN is played. In a visual novel, There is usually little, to no game play allowing the writers and developers to focus solely on story. For that reason, playing a visual novel is more like reading a book than playing a game. Because it resembles reading more than gaming, many western gamers are turned off by the genre. This holds true in Ever17. There is no gameplay, aside from picking the dialogue choices. Picking the correct choices will eventually give you the good endings, which lead into the true ending eventually. More on that later. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/solidbatman/e17/f6f293a0-2030-451b-a31f-0a3a903a2d6b_zps7345f33b.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nEver17 begins with you, the player, attending an underwater theme park called LeMU run by Leiblich Pharmaceutical, which is located 51 meters under the ocean. During a normal day at the park, an accident takes place and the park is evacuated as half the park is flooded. Everyone makes it out, except for a few individuals who become trapped in the theme park. LeMU is now under constant threat of implosion due to the water pressure which is slowly, but surely crushing the complex. The trapped people now have to hope for a timely rescue to come from the surface. Very quickly they discover, LeMU is not what it appears to be. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/solidbatman/e17/11-ever17-xbox-3_zps5a10a67b.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nDuring the opening scene (up to the moment of the accident), the players perspective will change between Takeshi Kuranari and a nameless character called Kid. Once the accident takes place, the player will choose who''s perspective they want to follow, Takeshi, or Kid. Both share some characters in common, but have some major differences between them. While playing the routes, the player will choose between one of two girls to find out the back story of (Sora and Tsugumi for Takeshi, You and Sara for Kid.) and discover more of the mystery surrounding LeMU. The characters begin to unravel the different mysteries as the novel goes on, including the true nature of existence itself. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/solidbatman/e17/84b15c6e-f28d-44b6-b4c6-1c5409873773_zpsd8727e16.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nBeing a sci-fi mystery, Ever17 throws out some complex terminology at times, from the Archimedes Principle, to the Third Eye. The novel does a good job explaining all of the concepts thrown out, but sometime delves a little too deeply into the explanation. For example, there is a hologram that is something of a key story piece and we are treated to a long explanation of how the hologram works. While it adds depth to the story, it also breaks the flow of the narrative somewhat. This is a minor complaint though since the explanations are still helpful regardless. Fans of sci-fi should thoroughly enjoy all of the explanations as well. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/solidbatman/e17/ME0001386011_2_zps6e2ffb76.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n[center][i]Science?[/i][/center]\r\n\r\nThis brings me to my next point on Ever17. The writing. In short, its fantastic for the most part. Each of the 4 main arcs start off in very similar fashion. Takeshi''s arcs both start off the same, as do Kid''s. This is a bit of a problem as the stories remain the same for 75% of the routes resulting in re-reading or flat out skipping previously read text. However, the last 25% of the 4 main arcs is completely different and usually filled with all sorts of plot twists, twists that set up for the true arc of the novel. The endings of each arc is extremely well written full of hints and clues allowing the reader to try and come up with his/her own theory of what is taking place.\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/ldvKurV.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nOnce each of the 4 main arcs are completed, a 5th arc is unlocked. Unlike the first four, the story shifts back and forth between Takeshi and Kid. The 5th arc also features a much different set of events as we finally see the mysteries of LeMU come to light in spectacular fashion. One mystery after another is solved, and yet more pile up. Impressively enough, these plot twists and answers make perfect sense. They don''t simply come out of no where. The first four arcs drop hints and clues the entire time, and the answers come in the final arc. You won''t usually be blind sided by a mystery being solved. In the end, it makes sense. It''s simply great writing by the KID staff in creating a complex mystery that doesn''t rely on random assumptions and unexplained plot devices. \r\n\r\nTying into the solid writing are characters. We have a handful of characters, and they are all interesting and complex. Reading, and discovering the dynamics of each character is addicting and full of mystery. Why doesn''t Sora eat? What exactly does Tsugumi know? Who is Coco? What happened to Kid''s memory? All of these questions pile on top of the already intriguing questions surrounding the LeMU complex, and we are provided with plenty of hints before the answers are given to us. Again, its very well written.\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/solidbatman/e17/af6a1d88-f668-4a9a-89a8-fd48510b29fa_zpsfac4d84c.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nBut all of this would be for nothing if our two main avatars, the characters you play as, weren''t equally as interesting. I''m happy to report that Takeshi''s and Kid''s perspectives are very interesting. Takeshi''s is a little bit more focused on the people around him, where Kid is more focused on himself and his apparent amnesia. Takeshi is simply visiting LeMU for the day with his friends while Kid simply doesn''t know why he is at LeMU. His memory starts from sitting on a bench at LeMU. He doesn''t even remember his own name. That caused me to have more interest in Kid''s story and perspective, while Takeshi''s was more of an emotional perspective. The fact that the two essentially see different things is in of itself an intriguing plot point. One that becomes clear as you finish the routes.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Ever17 is a much different experience than Clannad was. Being only my second long visual novel, it proved that romance doesn''t need to be the focus for a VN. A great cast of characters, coupled with a deep, complex mystery can easily become a one of the most engaging, thought provoking stories around. Ever17 does just that. While the early and middle parts of the first four routes can be monotonous, the end pay off is much more than worth it, and the final route is a mind blowing experience full of twists and turns sure to keep you on the edge of your seat. Ever17: The Out of Infinity is a visual novel that will keep you guessing and leave you with a great deal of satisfaction upon completing it.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Overall: [/u] 9.5/10[/b]\r\n\r\n[i]You can download Ever17: The Out of Infinity [url=http://fuwanovel.org/novels/17]here.[/url] You will need a bittorrent client such as utorrent to download the visual novel[/i]', 1714, 16, '2013-03-06 02:51:41', 46, 'no', ':34:16:2:1:1:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:55', 'Water pressure is a pain', '2013-03-06 20:30:40', 0, 0, 0, 0, 16, 128, '', '', 'no', '', '', ''),

This mansion is full of supernatural creatures, and Cooper will receive help along the way from the many hired hands that work there.\r\n\r\nOriginal Platform: Xbox[/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n-Visuals- 6/10.\r\n\r\nThe game applies a cartoonish style, and therefore doesn?t do a lot to either impress or disappoint.\r\nIt doesn?t look inherently bad or amazing, the style is solid. There is nothing mindblowing about the graphics, but It is consistent.\r\nNo big bugs to report graphics wise.\r\n\r\n-Sounds- 7/10.\r\n\r\nGhoulies has it?s own neat soundtrack, and a fitting theme song. \r\nCreaky doors, scary noises and the monsters all make for a neat, thematic, humorous game. Now, there is nothing to complain about sound wise, but even so it doesn?t necessarily leave any lasting impact. In keeping with the games light-hearted tone, the music is not too deep and dark, but very upbeat and light.\r\nThe characters do not speak, but merely make sounds based on the situations. Their dialogue is presented as text during the story sequences. \r\n\r\n-Gameplay- 7.5/10.\r\n\r\nThe controls always took some adjusting to, but once you get the feel of it everything?s fine. Some things to note that stick out are; the left and right tiggers operate the camera, and attacks are directed with the right analog stick. Getting past these two things shouldn?t be too difficult, and once you do the whole game is great fun.\r\nThere?s a wide variety of weapons always at your disposal. You can fight Ghoulies with almost everything in the room. Often you?re also given mission specific weapons, for example when you have to kill lots of zombies, a water pistol/super soaker will be made available to you, shooting the zombies with it causes them to melt, and if fighting mummies fire is handy.\r\nAlso included are some ?fright? mini games where your character is spooked by something in the environment, and you have to punch in a button combo to prevent passing out.\r\n\r\n-Story- 5/10.\r\n\r\nThe story is simple, humorous and light hearted. It isn?t designed to be a heavy cornerstone of the game, but it does help carry you through particularly challenging levels with it?s simple but well meant humor.\r\n\r\n-Overall- 7.5/10.\r\n\r\nThis game has always been a favorite of mine, but I admit it isn?t for everyone. It?s a simple and funny game not meant to be taken that serious.\r\nIt?ll entertain you through and through if you?re into the genre, but don?t count on something hugely memorable.\r\nEven by today?s standards it remains pretty damn entertaining, and most people would probably find it fun enough to justify purchase. I?d even say it?s suitable for all ages; the humor can be appreciated on different levels by all, the simplicity can appeal to a younger crowd while the challenges can appeal to older audiences.\r\nI recommend it to everyone who?s just looking for something fun to play, but isn?t expecting anything game changing.\r\n', 1859, 9, '2013-03-19 18:36:54', 46, 'no', ':16:34:9:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:55', 'Retrospect Reviews #1', '2013-03-19 20:45:39', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 70, '', '', 'no', '', '', ''),

You pretty much pay $8 per GB of RAM and they will host it 24/7. With this, you get customer support for problems, no player restrictions, a free MySQL Database, full FTP access, and instant one-click download and installations of plugins. The server can be accessed from a control panel, which multiple people, if the admin so wishes, can go in and read/write server properties.\r\nThe control panel can be set up to have automatic backups of the world(s) just in case something happens.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a Hamachi can be used to host the server and you can do everything on your own for free. Biggest drawback for this is that the server cannot be run 24/7, harder to install and configure plugins, and you pretty much have to do everything manually, all while using precious computer resources.\r\n\r\nI highly recommend a Hamachi server if the server is going to stay small, where little management is needed. Whereas, if we are going to get bigger, a Dedicated server will be better for it can handle a heavy load of management with ease.\r\n\r\nUnless they have a high tech computer with at least 4GB of dedicated RAM with a strong processor and a good knowledge of server management, they should stick with Dedicated Server"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo gentlemen, it is up to you. As I said, I will cover the first two months, possibly more but I''m leaving the decision up to you three because this is your thing.

[b]No spawn egg abuse of any kind[/b] which includes but is not limited to: spawning multiple entities of the same mob, several different mobs, spawning them then killing them, or using chicken eggs to rapidly spawn chickens. There is enough lag without this and we are already in the process of adding in a plugin to remove mobs upon command. If you are caught doing this, you will be temporarily kicked from the server until further notice. If this remains an issue, you will be permanently kicked. [b]Spawn eggs are temporarily disabled and should not spawn anything anyway, but slips can be made.[/b]\r\n\r\n3. [b]DO NOT destroy someone else''s work[/b] or modify it without their permission. You can help others, but destroying someone else''s work (or changing something you don''t like) is just plain rude and obnoxious. This will not be tolerated. You may, however, build whatever you like, wherever you like, so long as it doesn''t conflict with other creations.\r\n\r\n4. [b]Follow the rules of DreamSpand itself.[/b] Just because you''re on the server doesn''t mean that the regular rules don''t apply.\r\n\r\n5. [b]Do not cause any unnecessary lag[/b] such as high-powered/multiple redstone clocks (one or two is okay if used correctly), loads of TNT, turning the lighting systems on and off repeatedly, placing spawners, etc. Every now and then with permission from the staff is okay, but all the time on your own accord is intolerable.\r\n\r\n6. [b]No killing other players or setting another player''s spawn point[/b]. This includes teleporting them to 0, 0, 0, and failure to abide by these will result in you being de-opped (if you were/are an op).\r\n\r\n7. [b]Don''t clear another player''s inventory[/b] unless they ask you to. It''s just plain wrong.\r\n\r\nOver all, have fun.

I''ll crush you so flat the players will think you''re 2D monsters!"\r\n\r\n"Uh oh, Iffy snapped! She broke the fourth wall!"[/i][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat if there was a game where consoles and video game publishers were represented by young cute anime girls fighting evil across the game industry? If your first thought was, "Uhhhh, no thanks," then this game is not for you. But if you thought, "Hmmmm, that could be kind of fun," well then you are in luck.\r\n\r\nHyperdimension Neptunia mk2 is the second entry in the very niche Hyperdimension Neptunia series. The series is set in the fictional land of Gamindustri which is cared for by four CPU Goddesses. Neptune rules over the land of Planeptune, Vert over Leanbox, Blanc rules Lowee, and Noire heads up Lastation. Picking up on the theme yet? These four goddess'' are the stars of the first game, but take a side character role in mk2. Instead, the leads of mk2 are the CPU Candidates who are the heirs to their kingdoms (a play on the hand held video game market). \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/solidbatman/hyperdimension_neptunia_mk2_featured_screenshot_04_zps43f0ca72.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nHyperdimension Neptunia mk2 opens with the four CPU goddess'' trapped in the Gamindustri Graveyard, where the old and forgotten goddess (consoles) go to rest forever. A criminal syndicate known as ASIC has trapped them to promote piracy throughout the lands of Gamindustri. Nepgear, the younger sister to Neptune launches a hopeless rescue attempt and is easily defeated by CFW Judge. She manages to escape With the goddess'' trapped, ASIC seems poised to flood the world with pirated goods, but they seem to have a different motive than simply flooding the world with pirated material. \r\n\r\nNepgear travels back to Planeptune to recover her strength and launch another rescue attempt to bring back Neptune and the other goddess''. She is quickly joined by her friends IF and Compa as the three set out to defeat ASIC and bring peace back to Gamindustri. \r\n\r\nMk2''s story is nothing grand, or even good. The story simply acts as a vessel to insert as many jokes and references towards the video game industry as possible. Every single character is some sort of personification of either a game developer/publisher or a console and the locations in the game do the same thing. For example, on your quest, you will come across Atari Marsh, and Midgard. One disappointing aspect of the story is the fact that it really doesn''t have much to say about piracy. It attempts to debate the pros and cons before a certain boss fight, but it feels so out of place for a game that doesn''t take anything seriously. The debate wasn''t even that well done anyway as it literally became an argument over whether or not people can enjoy things they didn''t buy. We all know the answer to that already.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the story is told is part of another problem. The game feels very disjointed. Events take place in a visual novel type format where portraits of the characters appear on screen with the text underneath them. Where in every visual novel, the person talking will be on screen, this is not the case in mk2. Nepgear and Uni (the CPU Candidate of Lastation) might be talking to IF and Compa but only Nepgear and Nisa are on screen. This means the person talking is not always on the screen leading to some confusion as to who is talking. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/solidbatman/Conversation-1_zps89937144.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nAnother issue contributing to the disjointed feeling is the Chirper system. Much like Twitter, when you visit the capital cities, the NPCs and characters will Chirp their thoughts. Some of these Chirps lead to secret items and events. The problem is with the events which happen out of chronological order. A character may wish for something to happen in a Chirper scene, but that event has already happened. It''s like the character had already forgotten about it. As long as you visit the towns often and check the Chirper constantly, the problem can be avoided.\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/solidbatman/75410343_zpse06a0d1e.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nBy checking these Chirper events out though, you can increase the affection your party members have towards you. While I found no bonus for doing so, it is necessary to have high affection from your party members to achieve the True Ending. It''s a shame that the events are typically pointless and boring. Every character is one dimensional, so we never see any sort of complex character growth or any sort of growth in general (outside of breast size... I''m not even joking). This makes for a funny, but uninteresting cast of characters.\r\n\r\nAnother key factor in getting the true ending is the Shares systems. By completing Guild Quests (side missions) you can increase and decrease the popularity of the nations in the game. For example, going out and defeating 5 Horsebirds may increase Planeptune''s shares by 10, but decrease Lowee''s shares by 10. By getting each nations shares up to a certain number, you can unlock new characters and more events as well as getting a True Ending.\r\n\r\nAs is typical with JRPGs, there is an economy in place where you can buy, sell, and create items. Item creation is flat out useless and you will never really run out of money (and even if you do, there is free DLC that will net you over 3,000,000 credits). Buying items will basically be limited to healing and revive items as well as weapons. Armor and charms can easily be found in dungeons or as rewards for quests. \r\n\r\nThe battle system of mk2 is by far, the best part of the game. It''s your typical turn based battle system with free movement and attack ranges. Your basic attacks are divided into 3 separate buttons. Triangle is your weak, multiple hit attack, square performs your heavy attacks, and X takes care of your Break attacks. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/solidbatman/75413515_zps2c5ec40d.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nEach enemy has a Guard Break Bar. By using break attacks, you can try and take out all of the enemy''s break points. By doing so, the enemy will have lower defense and end up taking extra damage. \r\n\r\nYour attacks take up AP which regenerate each turn. For example, stringing together 3 rush attacks may use up 60 AP. If you have more AP, you can continue attacking, or stop attacking and carry over AP to the next turn. Every time you hit and enemy, you will gain SP. SP is required, along with AP, for special attacks. Want to summon the creator of Mega Man from the skies to shoot a laser out of his mouth?\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/solidbatman/ss-037_zpsf1c3c03b.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nBetter save your SP and AP. With careful planning, you can launch extra long combos and cause massive damage to your enemy. For a certain boss, I spent about 10 turns building up my AP and SP, then launched a massive 81 hit combo that caused well over 200,000 damage to the boss and ended the battle that very turn. \r\n\r\nYou can also hit multiple enemies at once with the free movement and ranged attack system in place. When it is your turn, you have a set area that you can move in. By positioning yourself, you can hit multiple enemies at once with your attacks. The enemies can also do the same to you, and bosses can easily end a battle in one turn if you bunch your party members up. However, if they are too far apart, the won''t be able to support each other with items and magic. It''s a good thing the battle system is so fun, since all their is to do in the game is battle. \r\n\r\nYou will constantly have to replay the same dungeons over and over for side quests and level grinding if you want to keep up with the sometimes over powered bosses. The grinding nature of the game will deter some, but rest assured, because the battle system is so fun, and the battles are fast paced, you will find that level grinding doesn''t hurt the flow of the game (unlike the story-telling). \r\n\r\nWhile Hyperdimension Neptunia mk2 fails in terms of a good story and interesting characters, it is held up by solid turn based battles and plenty of humor. Not all of the humor lands, but the more into gaming you are, the more enjoyment you''ll find in the humor. If you don''t mind the over the top fan service and dull story, and just want a solid battle system that you can relax and play, this game is for you. If you are looking for an actual [i]good[/i] game, this is not the game for you.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed this game, but only as a game I could simply sit back and turn my mind off. I didn''t question ethics or my role in the universe. I just enjoyed this simple, fun JRPG.\r\n\r\n[b][u]Overall[i]: 6.5/10[/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', 1949, 16, '2013-03-26 18:05:09', 46, 'no', ':8:9:2:16:1:1:1:1:5:55', 'Fun, but not very good', '2013-05-05 15:28:49', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 108, '', '', 'no', '', '', ''),

This allows you to spawn NPCs of any mob type, including Players. You can spawn an NPC carbon copy of an actual player of the server and their skin will match their real counter-part''s skin. So if you see another you on the server, don''t freak out, it''s just an NPC. These NPCs can have way-point paths, they can talk, look at you, hold things, act as sentries (supposedly, though I have seen no proof of this yet) and do some other stuff. Refrain from spawning the Ender Dragon as an NPC as it does still cause damage. If you would like to experiment with this, please create a new Multi-Verse world and use it for testing. Just be sure to delete it when you''re done, if you aren''t going to use it again.\r\n\r\n2. [b]Multiverse-Portals[/b] plugin has been installed. With this, you can select a [b]WorldEdit[/b] region to be designated as a portal to a specified world. The survival map and the creative map both now have one that link to each other, as well as [b]Citizen[/b] NPC guards (one of which is a carbon copy of [user=16]). These portals are protected with [b]WorldGuard[/b], and should not be breakable. If they are, then either please fix it yourself (if you''re familiar with the API) or post about it here so that it may be handled.\r\n\r\n3. [b]Spawn[/b] plugin has been installed. This plugin is more for just fun than it is anything else. You can spawn whatever you like, with the amount being up to 100 at a time. Just try not to abuse this, it''s something shiny I added for fun, don''t make me regret it. You can also spawn players or mobs riding other players or other mobs (for instance, a Villager riding a Pig, or solidbatman1 riding vibrantblade18 ). Ask me for the wiki if you''re interested.\r\n\r\n4. [b]BiomeEdit[/b] plugin has been installed. Another one of those shiny things, but useful too, if used correctly. You can use [b]WorldEdit[/b] to select a region and then define it as a biome, or use a "brush" to manually select where you want a specific biome to be, with a specified radius and a specified shape. Has the weather effects and everything.\r\n\r\n5. [b]Notebook[/b] plugin has been installed. Self-explanatory, keeps specific notes about certain users.\r\n\r\nGonna try to lessen the amount of plugins now.

Upgrading the RAM of the server will also make things run smoothly once we get closer to 2 dozen plugins. The only problem i see is if people spam and abuse these plugins. For example, try to not create a dozen NPCs yourself that have no use whatsoever. That adds to the load of the server.

(1996, 'Update: Return of The Minecraft Server', 'Automatic update was made by: [user=1][br][br]We are pleased to present the official return of the Minecraft server. It is no longer on the white-list and is publicly accessible. Before you enter, though, please give our [url=http://www.dreamspand.com/forum.php?act=topic&id=1904]rules thread[/url] a read. We have a number of features and securities installed. These include:\n\n1. [b]Citizens[/b] plugin. Ops can spawn NPC Players, great for roleplaying worlds. These NPCs can walk, talk, hold stuff, execute scripts, etc. We can even make carbon copies of other players.\n\n2. [b]LogBlock[/b] plugin. If a block is destroyed anywhere, it is logged in our SQL database. It will store who did it and what block it was, as well as the date and time of when it occurred. This will protect your creations.\n\n3. [b]Spawn[/b] plugin. This will allow you to spawn any entity, anywhere, up to 100. Please refrain from spawning in survival mode, and refrain from spawning any highly dangerous mobs at all. If you abuse this, you will be jailed and banned. Indefinitely on both accounts.\n\n4. [b]Notebook[/b] plugin. Lets admins and mods keep notes about specific users.\n\n5. [b]WorldEdit[/b] plugin. This one is way too much to explain, simply look it up if you want an explanation.\n\n6. [b]DynMap[/b] plugin. This is for the staff - we can view any part of the map from the browser and see absolutely everything going on.\n\n7. [b]WorldGuard[/b] plugin. This allows us to guard things from other people, from protecting blocks to disallowing even chest access.\n\n8. [b]BiomeEdit[/b] plugin. This will come in handy later and is currently also for the staff, but allows you to change a specified radius into the biome of your choosing.\n\n9. [b]Jail[/b] plugin. Use your imagination on this one - we can jail players for a certain amount of time, and all they can do is move around in their cell.\n\n10. [b]Multi-Verse[/b] plugin. This includes MVP Inventories (separate inventories for worlds) and MVP Portals (travel between worlds using our admin-made, GUARDED portals). \n\nThese are so far the only plugins we have, but that''s likely to change. We''re going to be working on a roleplaying world as well, featuring the NPCs and site-specific lore.\n\nWhen you first spawn in, you will enter Valhalla, a hand-made creation by SammyAxe / Absalon. This was before we had WorldEdit, and it is our most treasured building. It was built by hand in the first few days of opening the server, and it is beautiful. It''s based off of Nordic Mythology, and you will exit it through a rainbow bridge. To your left there will be a portal to the survival map - simply jump in to be teleported. Your inventory and equipment will change to its respective world when you do this. If you walk straight after you first spawn, you will see 10 rules in a row. Please read and obey them or we are going to have a problem. There is a guard walking around the rule signs, carrying a diamond sword. It is an NPC and yes, it is Master Chief from Halo (I named him Guard and the skin applied itself). \n\nThere are a whole lot of other things that you''re just gonna have to see - but don''t be a jerk, and don''t screw up anything that doesn''t belong to you. If you absolutely have to screw something up, then make something really, really nice and either mess it up yourself, or ask us to do it for you. We''ll be more than happy to destroy your crap if you''re the same towards us. Be respectful, and have fun. We currently have no issues or enemies, and I would like to keep it that way.

Each kingdom had its own ''personality.'' We had a dwarf-like city that lived in the mountains, an elf-like city that lived in the woods, and a human-like city that lived in the plains. Each kingdom had its own castle, and surrounding lands. Each player can either join a kingdom, or become outlaws. Each Kingdom had its own set of jobs, the players can choose a job within their kingdom. The Kingdoms could also become allies through trade or become enemies. This is up to the citizens, they decide. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, my old server did not utilize this for our server died out before we could fully implement it.

They are fierce fighters as well, their tool creations are unmatched, and some say, they have powers. They equip the Kingdoms with wood and tools. \r\n[*] Plainsmen are found in the plain biome. They are farmers and live off of the ground and the livestock they attend. They equip the Kingdoms with farmed food, and meat off of their livestock. They are neutral, and hold no ill will towards others, unless they are provoked and attacked first. Then, they use their fierce archery skills to defend. \r\n[*] Snowmen are found in the snow biome. They are peace keepers of the Kingdoms, scribesmen, and scholars. They are majestic people and seldom let people on their lands. not much is known about them, other than they are slow to anger, and when they were, a war broke out and left forests burnt and mountains blown to ashes. Some say, they are aided by spirits of their ancestors. \r\n[*] Nomads are found in the desert biomes. They are simple living people that keep to themselves. A person''s wealth is defined by the wells they have. They are expert sculptures and build their houses out of sandstone. Rich clear glass, glass that is filled with light, and sculpted sand litter their Kingdom. They have a knact for glowstone, and are always on the lookout for glow dust. They often become mercenaries to get more from the other kingdoms. \r\n[*] Miners are found in mountainous biomes. They are proud people, and are skillful in the works of stone. Their cities lie deep in the mountains, protected by thick walls of stone. Gold, Silver, Diamond, and Iron litter the city walls. their lust for jewels is unmatched and usually horde them and trade very little to the outside world. They create tools made out of diamond and gold, their opponents in battle are awestruck by the glittering waves of soldiers, they see nothing but glitter before they are struck down. \r\n[*] Junglers are found in the jungle biome. They are savages and brutes. Their actions are not bound by any laws. And attack any and all trespassers. From the history of the world, the junglers never created cities, they kept to ancient structures that were built from something that is now extinct.

(2023, 'The Three Kingdoms', 'Alright, so the votes are finally in!\r\n\r\nWe are tied with Woodsmen, Miners, and Snowmen! Thank you everyone who voted! (which is literally everyone) Now we can finally start to make this happen. \r\n\r\nRight now, I am at a loss as to whether to make this world in a Large Biome, or Regular map. But before we can make this decision, we need to thoroughly explore the Kingdoms map (large biome), so we can use dynmap to see where we can put the center of the kingdoms. The Woodsmen live in the forest biome, the Miners in mountainous region, the Snowmen in snowy biome, and the village in a plain biome. \r\n\r\nThe good thing about large biomes, is that it will make things a bit more interesting. Kingdoms will be far apart, so each kingdom can control large portions of land. This is good when we become a large server. However, each kingdom needs to be connected to the village, so it will be better if we can get all four biomes to be next to each other, for a road needs to be built. The good thing about a regular map, is that the kingdoms will be closer together, promoting a faster paced game. If things get too close, we can choose a farther biome. So choose the next closest snow biome, for example. So think about this, let me know what you guys think. but either way, we need to explore the maps before we build anything. \r\n\r\nIm trying to find a way for dynmap to show unaccessed portions of the map automatically. These portions are black, for those chunks have not been loaded, for no one has been there yet. If i do find a way, then everything will be simple. \r\n\r\nUntil then, if any of you have free time, we need to start exploring the Kingdom world. As you can see on dynmap, i already explored most of the jungle biome. We dont need to fill out everything, but we need to at least get the perimeter of each biome, to get a glimpse. \r\n\r\nSorry for the big wall of text. \r\n\r\nOh and we need Kings. So choose one of the kingdoms if you are up for the challenge. if two people want to do the same one, then the PvP arena in creative mode will settle the winner. \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nA bit of info for each kingdom, subject to change, please discuss\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nWoodsmen are hunters and gatherers. They are also lumbermen, they clear down forests to make room for expansions. They live in log cabins and are expert woodusers. They can craft the finest wooden tables, in all the lands. They are fierce fighters, they are swordsmen and can tame dogs to help them fight in battle. They supply the world with wooden products and the finest steak. \r\n\r\nMiners are builders and strong. They are usually found in their mines, looking for gold and diamond. When they are outside, it is mainly on the road to the village to sell what they have. Their city is located deep within a mountain, the rocks carved to marvelous stone, glittered with diamond and gold. They are rowdy fighters, preferring axes and hand-to-hand combat. Their repair skills are unmatched and provide services for the world. However, they do not welcome those who trespass into their lands.\r\n\r\nSnowmen are gentle folk. They are found in the snow biome, often living with the earth. Their houses are made out of ice that never melts, and hardly break down trees, but instead live in them. They are diplomats, scholars, scribesmen, and potion masters. It is rare for them to go to war, they usually try to talk down the other kingdoms out of war, but when they do fight, they use their bows and potions. Their archers are the best in all the lands, their potions are said to heal and to poison. The last war that they have fought, left forests burned and mountains to dust.

At some point the Junglers began attacking and raiding trading caravans and merchants passing near their territory. The Woodsmen, Plainsmen and Snowmen sent scouts to find the reason for these savage attacks, but were killed.\r\n\r\nBig War: After their scouts were slaughtered, open war broke out between those 4 Kingdoms (Woods, Snow, Plains and Junglers) while the Miners profiteered immensely by supplying the Woodsmen, Snowmen and Plainsmen with weapons and armor. The Nomads wanted to remain neutral, but offered mercenary armies to Woods, Snows and Plains.\r\nJunglers were relentless, and eventually managed to almost completely eradicate the Plainsmen, forcing them out of the war, and leaving the plains undefended. The Junglers gained a foothold at the center of the remaining Kingdoms, and managed to launch deadly assaults on the Miners, forcing them into the war.\r\nAfter some time (years/months?) the 4 Kingdoms managed to pool their remaining resources, and launch a strategic attack against the Junglers. Despite being outnumbered, they succeeded in pushing them back to their homelands, and eventually won the war.\r\n\r\nPost Big War: The 4 remaining Kingdoms began rebuilding what was destroyed, and set up strongholds and outposts near the Jungler border to ensure they''d never return.\r\nThe surviving few Plainsmen banded together with many other people from the different kingdoms and established a new home for themselves, encompassing qualities of all 4 Kingdoms.\r\n\r\nCurrent Time: Despite having rebuilt most of the damage, the Kingdoms are on edge as the result of a border dispute regarding the lost territory of the Plainsmen, and who should have access to their resources, and different opinions on what to do with the Jungler Kingdom; some want to pursue them, others want to build a wall around it.\r\n\r\nThe Snowmen are now investigating the cause of the war, and the Junglers sudden rise in power, the other Kingdoms believe they may be hiding something.\r\n\r\nThe Miners are strained as they have to provide materials for the other kingdoms as well as their own to help rebuild, and believe they have a claim to new territory.\r\n\r\nThe Nomads, despite being somewhat removed from the Kingdoms before the war, are now seeking a bigger role in the politics of the Kingdoms, and hope to expand as well.\r\n\r\nThe Woodsmen are helping rebuilding and supplying materials, and have the most men maintaining the new outposts near the Jungler border.

(2052, 'Re: The Three Kingdoms', 'Here''s the revised Kingdom descriptions:\r\n\r\n\r\n?  Woodsmen are found in the forest biome. They are great builders, they have the ability to clear down forests and create great structures in their place. During the war the Woodsmen formed the backbone of the Kingdoms armies. After the war they resumed their old ways, and helped rebuilding their own, and the other Kingdoms. They are fierce fighters as well, their tool creations are unmatched. They equip the Kingdoms with wood and tools. \r\n\r\n?  Plainsmen are found in the plain biome. They are farmers and live off of the ground and the livestock they attend. They equip the Kingdoms with farmed food, and meat off of their livestock. They are neutral, and hold no ill will towards others, unless they are provoked and attacked first. Then, they use their fierce archery skills to defend. In the Big War their Kingdom was lost, and the survivors banded together with outcasts of the other Kingdoms to form the central Village.\r\nAfter the war, the lack of food they used to provide resulted in hunger for all the kingdoms.\r\n\r\n?  Snowmen are found in the snow biome. They are peace keepers of the Kingdoms, scribesmen, and scholars. They are majestic people and seldom let people on their lands. not much is known about them, other than they are slow to anger, and don?t like to enter a war they haven?t already won. Some say, they are aided by spirits of their ancestors. \r\nDuring the Big War they provided potions to the Kingdom armies, and had to rely heavily on Nomad Mercenaries for front line soldiers. After the war they retreated to their great halls, and distanced themselves from the aftermath, while looking into the Junglers reasons for attacking.\r\n\r\n?  Nomads are found in the desert biomes. Before the war they were a majestic people, building great pyramids out of glass and sand, their kingdom was said to be the most beautiful one. When the war broke out they faced most of the initial attacks, and much of their Kingdom was destroyed. They began to hire themselves out as mercenaries, and helped the other Kingdoms win. After the war they were unable to fully rebuild their cities, and resorted to living a Nomadic life, travelling around the desert plains, offering their services to whomever could find them. Since the war they have wanted a larger role in the Kingdoms politics, and hope to one day rebuild what was lost. \r\n\r\n?  Miners are found in mountainous biomes. They are proud people, and are skillful in the works of stone. Their cities lie deep in the mountains, protected by thick walls of stone. Gold, Silver, Diamond, and Iron litter the city walls. their lust for jewels is unmatched and usually horde them and trade very little to the outside world. During the war the Miners remained neutral, and profiteered immensely by supplying the other Kingdoms with weapons and armor. Later in the war, the Junglers managed to crack their stone cities, and forced them into the war, and their armies were capable but few in number. After the war they resumed living as recluse, while selling stones and iron to the other Kingdoms.\r\n\r\n?  Junglers are found in the jungle biome. They are savages and brutes.

(2080, '5 Reasons to Watch Evangelion', '[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/jYzapVv.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[size=4][i]I like the Evangelion series.[/i][/size] No, I should say I love it. The Evangelion series started in October of 1994. What began as a monster of the day type show (where a different enemy would be defeated weekly), audiences were quickly treated to an in depth psycho-analysis of the characters as well as a very deep, thought provoking story regarding the nature of humanity. Since it''s initial TV run, the franchise has spawned a comic adaption, video games (none of which ever saw a Stateside release), and 5 movies (with another to come in a few years). Neon Genesis Evangelion (the TV series) has remained relevant on the anime scene for nearly 20 years now. Not too many shows, even on American television can claim the same. \r\n\r\nWith the third Rebuild of Evangelion movie coming out next week, (Rebuild is a series of movies that is writing a new Evangelion story, or an alternate story.) I thought it was time to introduce the reasons why [i]you[/i] should watch the series. \r\n\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/3dD3IsZ.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][u]5. Presentation[/u][/center]\r\n\r\nWhile the original Neon Genesis Evangelion certainly looks dated, it''s presentation is something that many modern anime cannot pull off. Gainax, the studio that created Neon Genesis Evangelion, had a tight budget to work with, so the battles are typically short, but intense. That being said, the original TV series was never about the battles, but everything else around the battles. Nerv HQ, the center directing Eva units, the giant robots, sounds and looks like an advanced NASA. The controllers act in a very official manner, we see routine tests being run, we hear the sound of machinery and computers doing their tasks. When in the city, we never see a large population, and instead see our characters alone. The sound of cicadas chirping in the background instead of the noises of an active city add that much more to the sense of isolation our characters feel. \r\n\r\nAnd then there are the Evangelion Units. They a large, pieces of machinery, that seem to be very human. They bleed, they go insane, and they seem to have free will at times. None of this is more evident than when Unit 01 goes berserk. We see a near animalistic rage from Unit 01 as it literally begins crawling on all 4 limbs to it''s enemy. It''s a scene that gives me chills no matter how many times I view it. The true nature of the Eva units is revealed through chilling, disturbing scenes such as that. \r\n\r\nWhile Neon Genesis Evangelion had incredible presentation, it clearly lacked on the action side relying on build up, and resolution to keep the viewer hooked. Rebuild of Evangelion, however, fixes the action with some of the most incredible animation I have ever seen. CG animation is blended perfectly with traditional 2-D animation making the action incredibly intense. One of the enemies (called Angels) in Neon Genesis Evangelion was a simple diamond block. In Rebuild, it is instead a geometric monstrosity that has no respect for mountains, or anything else. The action in Rebuild of Evangelion is some of the best you''ll ever see.\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/ROKACYb.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][u]4. Unpredictable[/u][/center]\r\n\r\nAs I said before, Neon Genesis Evangelion begins in a pretty cliche manner. Sure, there are hints, and foreshadows of where the story is going, but you will not pick up on them. After episode 16 or so, the story becomes much, much darker and the plot begins to finally come together. What is Nerv''s relationship with SEELE? What happened in The Second Impact? What is an Eva? These answers come at you, but the answer is never quite what you expect. Add to that a willingness to kill off main characters as well as some disturbing looks into the characters psyche, and you will be kept at the edge of your seat in trying to guess what comes next. \r\n\r\nThe End of Evangelion film might be the most unpredictable part of the whole franchise. With the goal of re-doing the original TV ending, EoE takes everything you know about our main characters and flips it upside down. We learn so much more about why characters made the choices they did, and we see the full effects of those choices finally play out. If you manage to correctly guess how Evangelion ends before seeing this film, then you are a prophet.\r\n\r\nRebuild of Evangelion had a hard task to do in regards to being unpredictable. How do you "rebuild" a classic franchise and still keep viewers guessing like the did during the original TV run? Well, without spoiling anything, Rebuild of Evangelion does exactly that. While the first Rebuild movie sticks fairly close to the events of the original series, the second film begins to carve out its own, incredibly well written, path. Characters make different choices, have different motivations, and seem well aware that more is at play than simply saving the world from the Angels. These changes will once again remind you that anything can happen in the Evangelion universe, and the only way to predict what is going to happen is to be extremely astute and pick up on even the smallest of details. \r\n\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/b6p2fXL.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][u]3. Giant Robots[/u][/center]\r\n\r\nDid you like the mindless romp of Transformers? Did you also enjoy the mind screwing of Inception? Lets combine the two and just watch your brain overheat from the awesome. I did say above that the action scenes in the original TV series were low budget. I also said they are intense. The Evangelion Units are giant humanoid robots built specifically to fight giant monsters known as the Angels. So, we have giant robots fighting giant monsters. What more do you really want? Giant robot fighting giant robot? Evangelion has that.\r\n\r\nRebuild of Evangelion ups the giant robot theme by making the Eva units even more bad ass by adding a new mode to Unit 02, causing Unit 01 to go god-mode when going berserk, and giving Unit 04 the justice it deserves (while unfitting music plays in the background). The Eva designs are complex and unique. In anime, mecha designs tended to blocky space craft looking robots, much like the old Transformers cartoons. Evangelion broke that mold by making the Eva units look more human, and living. They look more organic than any other mecha I''ve ever seen. This is for a reason I might add. \r\n\r\nSo yeah... giant robots. GIANT FREAKING ROBOTS! If you don''t like that, you may kindly turn in your man card now. \r\n\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/v8NKh9S.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][u]2. Characters[/u][/center]\r\n\r\nYou can have the best action scenes and animation but still fall short of being memorable or remembered for the wrong reasons (I''m looking at you Guilty Crown). A good show has good characters. A great show has bad characters that you actually like. Every single main character in Evangelion is a bad person in one way or another. Asuka is arrogant, Misato is too carefree, Gendo is just a jerk, Shinji is a wimp... the list goes on and on. Here is one of the greatest triumphs of Evangelion; you will still like the characters. Okay, maybe not Shinji, but for everyone else you will end up liking despite your first impressions. Neon Genesis Evangelion spends a great deal of time studying the characters through all sorts of different means. We learn of Asuka''s past and we see why she acts so cocky and arrogant. We see why Misato seems to be so carefree around Shinji, we see why Rei acts so cold and distant, and through Gendo and Shinji''s strained father-son relationship we uncover the past between them and learn some especially shocking things about Gendo. \r\n\r\nEveryone in Evangelion has flaws, and throughout the course of the show, we come to understand and accept those flaws, even if they can''t accept the flaws themselves. Rarely, if ever does a show make you hate, and like characters at the same time. I hated Shinji. I hated his apathy, I hated his outlook, I hated his lack of self-confidence, but I understood him. I knew exactly what was wrong with him and why. This understanding allows you to connect with characters, even if you have nothing in common with them. Not everything about the characters is revealed though, leading me to my final reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/iTNoF5C.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][u]1. Interpretation[/u][/center]\r\n\r\nShould you decide to watch Neon Genesis Evangelion and End of Evangelion, you will notice something. A lack of information. There are many things left unexplained even after End of Evangelion. Much debate has been had over whether or not this was intention but it does do one thing. It gets you thinking and discussing. There are a ton of fan theories ranging from the ending of the show, to the back story of a character''s pet and the sexuality of a penguin. Half the fun of this show is putting your own mark on it. With a convoluted, complex plot rife with under-explanations and unresolved plot lines, filling them in with your own ideas adds a sense of ownership to the show. Vibrantblade and myself often find ourselves debating over theories that we''ve come up with. Some theories are just for fun (like the penguin sexuality theory) and others are meaningful and could offer much more insight into the show and movies (continuation theory, loop theory). I promise, after viewing the show and movies, you will instantly begin plugging the holes with your own ideas... that is, if your mind ever recovers from the insanity of mixing giant fighting robots with in-depth psycho-analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n[i]If you have any questions, feel free to ask. If you are interested in getting into the series, PM me and I can work something out for you to view the series. I really, really want at least one person to try this show out. Vibrantblade can back me up on this, you will find something enjoyable in it.[/i]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][size=4][u]Trailers[/u][/size][/center]\r\n[center]\r\n-[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w1bVAHZ60]Neon Genesis Evangelion[/url]\r\n-[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKtNTo0mYko]End of Evangelion[/url]\r\n-[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0gWe_qOSc]Evangelion 1.11[/url]\r\n-[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYjMswe5uqQ]Evangelion 2.22[/url]\r\n-[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaLCuG-4wwk]Evangelion 3.33[/url][/center]', 2080, 16, '2013-04-18 23:21:16', 46, 'no', ':16:9:34:2:1:1:1:1:1:55', 'Aside from Asuka', '2013-04-18 23:21:16', 0, 0, 0, 0, 16, 7285, '', '', 'no', '', '', ''),

Giving it apples, sugar or wheat will help speed up both the growth process and the taming process. Eventually the horse will let you stay on it. At this time, you press the Sneak key to dismount your house, and may place a horse saddle on it. You can then control the horse with the WASD keys (or whatever you have set for your directional keys), once you have re-mounted it. While riding a tamed horse, your hunger and health bars are replaced by the horse''s. You automatically climb one-block-tall areas, and can jump over I think four blocks at a time. You start off at a somewhat fast walk, but then speed up a considerable amount.\r\n\r\n* Hay bales have also been added to the game, which horses seem to eat. They will likely be crafted using wheat, but this is unconfirmed.\r\n\r\n* Horse armor has also been added to the game.\r\n\r\n* When a horse wearing a horse saddle dies, it will drop a regular saddle (such as those found in dungeons and other treasure chest areas).\r\n\r\n* Horses (as well as other regular animals) can be tied to a fence using a rope/leash, and can also be "walked" around using this method.

(2086, 'Discussion Needed', 'Before I start, I mean no disrespect to anyone on these forums. This is purely a discussion that I feel needs to happen to clarify things for myself.\r\n\r\nI''ve been creating a lot of articles and content for this forum. My early stuff was easy stuff that I could pump out in 30 minutes to an hour. However, I have been putting a lot more effort into my writings and now I easily spend an entire day working on one article (longer if you count the brainstorming and planning). For example, my Clannad review took around an entire day to write, and about a week of gathering my thoughts and planning. In other words, I put a lot of effort into my works and with that, a lot of pride goes into them as well. \r\n\r\nIt pains me to then see no comments, and barely any views on these writings. After some thought, I realized that my gaming tastes, while varied, to primarily lie in the more niche, less popular genres while the majority of members here are more into the popular, better selling genres and games. In other words, I feel like I''m writing for the wrong audience. \r\n\r\nThere is a reason though, that I won''t change what I write about. Because the Minecrafts, Battlefields, Mass Effects have been written to hell and back again. Everyone hears about it, and because of that, it is always being written about. I don''t feel the need to write about those games because almost everything to say about them has already been written.\r\n\r\nI want to continue my writing, but when I post on here and see no discussion on my writings, it drains any motivation I have to continue. \r\n\r\n\r\nSo I ask you guys this.... do you want to be a more western, pop-culture gaming forum, or do you want a more niche, "unique" gaming forum with content that isn''t necessarily the most popular, but content that is hard to find anywhere else. \r\n\r\nI am not asking you guys to change anything. I am not demanding anything. \r\n\r\nI simply want to know what direction you guys want to go. I want to know, am I writing for the wrong audience? \r\n\r\n\r\nEdit: No I am not crying for comments, or asking for them.

(2087, 'Re: Discussion Needed', 'Well, as the one who actually built the site and is paying for it, I can say that I want the site to not be single-themed. In other words, I want it to have a little bit of everything, and you do that well. I am sorry for the lack of comments; it seems that not a lot of posting goes on at this site at all. And yes, going into the mainstream stuff would suck because [i]everybody[/i] does that.\r\n\r\nI have tried and tried to get more people posting content and replying to it and all of my efforts have been in vain, you are the only one that actually posts the content. Some others do, maybe every few weeks or months, but not like you do, and I''m very happy to have you as part of the team because you do your job and you do it well. If comments and readers are what you''re wanting, then I certainly can try harder to do that for you, because you cared enough to try hard for the site and that''s all I''ve been asking for.\r\n\r\nI agree that it''s rather disheartening to work very hard on something and have people not notice it. Take the site for example: I built it by hand, from scratch, and had it released in less than a month. It has state-of-the-art security and some fancy features that not a lot of places have, but it''s as dead as a doornail. It''s one of those things you just kinda learn to live with.\r\n\r\nAt my last community, I was a little bit bossy, and I made a vow to myself not to do that here. If they don''t want to post anything, I''m not going to force them to. I''m not saying you are, by any means, don''t get the wrong idea; I''m just saying that I''m not gonna be all authoritative on my team to get them to post. With all that''s going on in my life right now, I have absolutely no reason or right to point fingers at anyone else.\r\n\r\nAnyway, back to the point, I know you work hard, and you''re great with content, you really are. It''s kind of awesome to see all of the unique stuff you post, and while some of it is kind of odd to me, it doesn''t mean it is odd to others. It draws in a new, unique type of crowd, and that is what I want. Unique is good, because people are always looking for something different and I believe that straying away from the mainstream stuff is always good. It works in real life and it will work here too.\r\n\r\nSo my personal opinion is this: I''m disappointed that not a lot of staff members post and that it''s not often when they do. It makes the whole site look bad when the mods and admins hardly ever post, and yes, I can admit I''m amongst that group. I have the same motivation problem that you do: if I don''t see anyone else trying, it makes me feel like me trying would be pointless. Take the articles I tried to do for example, I did a bunch of those every day, and maybe one or two of the staff members did it once or twice, after I asked nicely a couple of times. I exempted you from that because of all the hard work you''ve done, you''ve clearly shown that you care and that you want the site to move in a good direction. You''re doing a fantastic job.\r\n\r\nAs for the others, I''m sorry to say this, but work harder. The Minecraft server is fun and all, and it''s distracted all of us, but the site is important too. We can''t forget about what the server was originally [i]for[/i]. Yes, I know I sound like a hypocrite right now, and I''m not gonna use the loss I''ve went through as an excuse (or any of the other crap going on right now), but as I''ve said many times before (and as solidbatman is saying now), we cannot be the only ones trying. That is not going to work. I did the majority of the work, hell, I did ALL of the work at my last two communities, simultaneously, when I was a young teenager. I was hoping that starting off with an actual team would provide even better results, but I guess I was wrong.\r\n\r\nI''m not trying to step on anyone''s toes or come off as a jerky, power-hungry savage, but come on guys, we can do so much better than this. We even got a new member yesterday, if anyone other than me and Mike even cared to notice. The games are fun but we have to remember what they were originally for. We need more posts, guys. I can ask my friends to post some stuff every so often that aren''t staff and are members here, but it''s not gonna look very good to anyone if we aren''t helping them.\r\n\r\nSo I don''t know about you, but starting tomorrow when I get back home, I''m going to post some stuff, I don''t care if it''s late at night, I''m doing something. You don''t have to start tomorrow or in the middle of the night, nothing like that, but don''t let me do this alone. I don''t wanna make any changes, but I will if I have to.

(2124, 'How To Add Pages And Games', 'Adding a page is really simple, and I''ve made it a little bit simpler now (though some may argue differently but eh).\r\n\r\nAlright, so, say you want to add in an article to the homepage. First, click on [b]Create Page[/b], and this will take you to the right screen. Next, type in the name of the page (what will display in the title bar) and then the page ID in its field (so the site knows what ID to pull data from). After that, type your content, and BEFORE you post it, select it all and copy it to a Notepad file, just in case. This ensures that you don''t lose all of your information! Alright, now, before you post it, be sure to change the category from None to [b]Articles[/b]. You can always go back into the page and change the category later if you mess up, but it''s really simple to get it right the first time.\r\n\r\nIt works similarly for the other pages, too. The only difference is that you just change the category, to say, Reviews, Gaming, Site Info, Community, Platforms, etc. And that''s how you add a page. Yep, it''s really that easy.\r\n\r\nManaging user submissions is also really simple. If a user submits a page, then the Manage Submissions will have the number of submissions by it (under the banner on the home page). You can view a list of all of the submissions this way. Click on the page and look it over. If you think it''s good, click on [b]Approve[/b]. This will automatically add it to the [b]User Content[/b] category. If you don''t like it, then click on [b]Deny[/b]. This will simply delete the page forever. Note that the site does log these actions for security purposes.\r\n\r\nNow, adding consoles and games is a little bit more complicated. First, what you wanna do is click on the [b]GMS Console[/b]. GMS stands for Game Management System, and it is how the site works.\r\n\r\n[b]Adding A Platform Key (Gaming Console)[/b]\r\nClick on [b]Platform Keys[/b]. This will take you to the list of consoles. On the top right hand corner of the table, click on [b]Add Key[/b]. For the Key ID, type something short and sweet. This is just a reference code and can be anything you want it to be, but it would be very good form to shorthand the name of the console. In the console name field, type the console''s name (who saw that one coming?). Click on [b]Create Key[/b] and then you''re done.\r\n\r\nOnce you''ve made the key, we need to do something with it. Click on [b]Create Page[/b] up top. Alright, now do the usual page name and ID stuff, but make it relevant to whatever console you''re making it for (i.e., if the key was Atari, I''d make that the page name too). Now then, the page content is really simple. This is where the site does most of the work for us. Now then, still using the atari key as an example, you''d type just this in the content box:\r\n\r\n{platform-id: atari}\r\n\r\nWith atari, of course, being the Key ID of the platform key. Now, before you click Save, change the category of the page to Platforms. Then click on [b]Save Page[/b] and you''re done. If the key is new, then no games will be listed under the name of it yet. Notice, though, how it automatically generates a list. This saves you the trouble of adding them all in yourself. Now we want to add a new game for this console.\r\n\r\n[b]Adding A New Game[/b]\r\nClick on [b]GMS Console[/b] up top. Then click on [b]Manage Games[/b]. You will see a list of every single game that has been added thus far. Now click on [b]Add Game[/b]. A long list of fields will be displayed on this screen. Fill in the required information (preferably WITHOUT copying and pasting information from somewhere else because we don''t want to get sued), and give a good, detailed description about the game. Once you''ve finished filling out the information, select what platform the game is on. So, if you were adding an Atari game, you''d select Atari. Notice how it''s already there, since we defined it as a platform key already. Now click on [b]Done[/b]. Now then, click on the [b]Consoles[/b] page. Since created an Atari page, it was added to the list of Console pages. Click on the name of the console you added, in this case, Atari. Now, instead of saying "No games were found," it will list all of the games that you''ve added under that platform key. Simple!\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about how to add or do something, then please ask me here and I will be more than happy to help.', 2124, 1, '2013-04-26 15:59:54', 46, 'no', ':1:9:2:16:1:1:1:1:55', 'Easy peasy lemon squeezy.', '2013-04-26 15:59:54', 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 40, '', '', 'no', '', '[Quick-Edit]', ''),

(2208, 'Bioshock Infinite Review', '[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/DjIGlrn.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][i]"The Seed of the Prophet shall sit the throne and drown in flame, the mountains of man."[/i][/center]\r\n\r\nI waited a long time for this game. After seeing the teaser trailer way back in 2010, I knew I had to have this game. After each appearance, after each preview, my hype for Bioshock Infinite continued to build. Every trailer showcased amazing gameplay, incredible scenery, and an unrivaled setting. To say it was one of my most anticipated games is an understatement. With so much hype built up, Bioshock Infinite could have easily disappointed me. Did it?\r\n\r\nNope. It met every expectation I had.\r\n\r\nBioshock Infinite opens up in a very similar manner as Bioshock. A storm is raging all around you as you are rowed by a man and a woman to a mysterious lighthouse in the middle of the ocean. The woman turns around, and hands you a box. It''s for you, Booker Dewitt, a former member of the US 7th Calvary, and a veteran of the Native American massacre at Wounded Knee. A picture of a girl is in the box. "Bring us the girl, wipe away the debt." \r\n\r\nRight from the get go, Bioshock Infinite sets such a haunting tone. When you open the doors to the lighthouse, a sign reads, "Of thy sins, shall I wash thee." As you climb the stairs, more signs are hung. "From Sodom, I shall lead thee. To thine own land, I shall take thee." \r\n\r\nThen, you come across a body, tied to chair, head covered in a cloth hood, blood pooled around it. A sign is pinned to it''s chest, "Don''t disappoint us." Then, another sign, "In new Eden soil, will I plant thee." When you finally reach the top, a giant red light begins flashing and the sound of horn is heard. You sit in a chair, and are suddenly rocketed up into the clouds, past the storm. What appears is breathtaking. An entire city, built over the clouds, suspended by giant blimp- like structures. Columbia, the pinnacle of American ingenuity lies before you.\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/solidbatman/bioshock%20inifinite/8870_screenshots_2013-03-30_00019_zpsaf3d051c.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nIt is one of the greatest opening acts of any game I have ever played. In the span of a few short minutes, the religious undertones of Bioshock Infinite are brought forward, and the contrast between utopia, and turmoil is subtly introduced to the player. It''s a flawlessly executed opening that hooked me. That hook never let go either.\r\n\r\nAs I stated above, you play as Booker Dewitt, a man charged with "rescuing" a girl named Elizabeth from Columbia, where she is locked in a tower. The time leading up to the meeting with Elizabeth is more of an introductory time to the city of Columbia. You''ll come across a fair, see propaganda posters plastered all over the walls, and take part in a disturbing raffle. Since the game takes place in 1912, the city of Columbia feels very much like a turn of the century, industrial revolution city. People look on in amazement at the new technologies at the fair. The women wear their big dresses, and the men, hats with suits. The buildings look like they are turn of the century as well, featuring a mix of "modern" and antiquated looks. As you walk through the streets of Columbia, you''ll notice the ultra-nationalistic fervor of the city. In fact, Columbia itself, acts almost as a religion. The citizens believe it to be the ideal American city, where white citizens are supreme and minorities are second class citizens, or worse. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/solidbatman/bioshock%20inifinite/2460078-2013-03-26_00010_zpsf02465e8.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nNow, Bioshock Infinite''s advertising showcased very fast paced, hectic gun battles through the streets of Columbia. With how amazing, and interesting Columbia is, it would be a shame to not be able to stop and enjoy the scenery. Luckily for us, the gun fights don''t over power the game, so there is plenty of time that you can just explore Columbia. You''ll find plenty of goodies such as audio recordings, early video footage, viewing areas, and more. All of this adds to the rich, interesting back story of Columbia. You''ll learn more about the government, the history, the people, and the social rifts within the city. Unlike Rapture in the original Bioshock, normal people do live in Columbia, and you''ll see them going about their daily lives. You''ll see a market place, young men trying to woo some women, kids playing with a leaking fire hydrant, worshipers at a shrine, and plenty more. The city feels alive and vibrant, and works as a wonderful backdrop to the story and main characters.\r\n\r\nThe story really begins to pick up once you find Elizabeth and encounter Songbird for the first time. It''s a very well done meeting between Booker and Elizabeth, one actually inspired by Disney''s many princess movies according to Ken Levine (the director and creator of the series). Elizabeth is a wonderfully written character. She displays amazement at new things, but wants so bad to see the world below, the Sodom in which citizens must never see. We slowly learn more about her through her interactions with Booker, which are also written extremely well. She comes across like a young child, yet acts and behaves in a mature manner. It''s a very interesting contrast to see and slowly, her child like nature fades away as more of Columbia''s secrets are brought to light.\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/solidbatman/bioshock%20inifinite/extra-image_zpsff4df990.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nIrrational Games did away with the silent protagonist from the first Bioshock, instead opting for a fully fleshed out character for Bioshock Infinite. Booker Dewitt isn''t just an emotionless killer like many FPS protagonists are. He has a rich back story and a strong personality. Despite the fact he just needs Elizabeth to wipe away his debt, he shows genuine concern and curiosity about Elizabeth leading to some very nice character development for both characters. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/solidbatman/Elizabeth_zps28ca89ef.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nThe voice acting is top notch for every character in the game, especially for Booker and Elizabeth. The actors poured emotion into every line and really felt like they were the characters. The voice actors actually had input on their characters too, but were never told the back story on the characters they were portraying. Ken Levine stated that it was his hope their relationship would grow and that that growth would show in the game as the two became closer. Another interesting choice made for the voice acting was the casting. Troy Baker, who gave the voice for Booker, is an industry veteran, but Courtnee Draper, the voice for Elizabeth is a somewhat of a newcomer to the industry. This was to tighten the bond between the two according to Levine. Whatever Levine did, it worked. The two deliver some of the best voice acting that this generation of gaming has seen to date. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/solidbatman/bioshock%20inifinite/Bioshock_infinite_wallpapers_HD-1-1024x640_zps288db1b9.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nThe story of Bioshock Infinite is far, far more ambitious than the story of Bioshock. It features more twists and turns, and is told in a much cleaner manner than the original Bioshock. Instead of all dialogue happening through a radio, it plays out more like a first person movie, complete with cut scenes that blend in perfectly with the gameplay. This results in a tight, well told story, and thank goodness its well told. It is by far the best story I have ever seen out of a first- person shooter. It features the character development of JRPGs, the soundtrack of a JRPG, and the plot twist of a JRPG, yet this is a story that can only be told in a first person shooter format. It absolutely amazing what the team at Irrational has managed to pull off with Bioshock Infinite''s story. \r\n\r\nBioshock Infinite''s story is certainly more than enough to put it into the great game category. The gameplay is what puts it into the incredible category. If you have played the original Bioshock, and are familiar with the dual weaponry style of it, you won''t have much new to learn with Infinite. It''s standard FPS gameplay with some major twists. Early on into the game, you are introduced to something called Vigors. These Vigors allow you to use special powers. Some let you take over turrets, others electrocute your enemies, and others summon a flock of crows to distract your enemies and make them more vulnerable to damage, among many more. The Vigors all are extremely useful for different situations. If you need to do some crowd control for instance, launching the Murder of Crows Vigor at your enemies, then blowing them away with a shotgun will prove effective. If you need to slow down a powerful enemy, shooting the electrobolt can give a the edge you need. Mastering which Vigors to use and when will make the game more varied, and easier to clear the way of enemies. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/solidbatman/bioshock%20inifinite/infinite1_zps37494227.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nVigors can be upgraded as well. Across Columbia, there are machines that sell upgrades to your Vigors that will add new perks to them, increase their range or duration, or make them cause more damage. These upgrades are very expensive though, so you''ll be forced to pick and choose upgrades rather than trying to get them all. \r\n\r\nYou can''t just use your Vigors nonstop, of course. You''ll need Salts to fuel the Vigors. Salts, like ammo and health, can be found all over the city of Columbia. But what if, you run out in the middle of a pitched battle with enemies? This is where Elizabeth comes in handy. She will actively scavenge the areas, finding all sorts of goodies for you. Run out of ammo on your carbine? If she finds one, she will toss you a new one so you don''t even have to reload. Run out of Salts for your Vigors? She''ll do her best to find more. Elizabeth accompanies you through many parts of the game, yet it never felt like an escort mission. Her AI kept her out of the way, and the fact that she couldn''t be harmed by enemies anyway was a major relief. She will take care of herself, leaving you do just worry about the enemies.  \r\n\r\nElizabeth has another skill that proves very helpful. She can open things called Tears. In these Tears are objects in another dimension. By opening a Tear, she can bring the object to your dimension to aid you in combat. Sometimes, a turret will be in a Tear. Open the Tear and let it fire away at your enemies. This ability adds some more strategy to the battles, but not as much as the Skylines.\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/solidbatman/bioshock%20inifinite/8c2e745ab64830c6542efc473137bd37_content_large_zps1d6bc929.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nThe Skylines are suspended rails that act as a cargo transportation system to carry cargo between the different areas of Columbia. Using a modified grappling hook, you can attach to these Skylines and fly around the city. They allow you to ambush enemies, outflank them, find better cover, or just get from point A to point B faster. Your enemies can use the Skylines as well, so if you use them to find cover, you better be ready for some enemies to come following. If you are on the Skylines and an enemy is below you, you can unleash a powerful attack from above that will send your enemy flying. So if enemies are spread out, use a Skyline to knock them out while you remain moving and less of a target. \r\n\r\nControl on the Skylines can take a bit of getting used to though as movement is very fast and abrupt. Still, it adds yet another wrinkle to the standard FPS formula and builds upon the semi- strategic gameplay of the original Bioshock. However, the meat of any FPS is still the guns.\r\n\r\nIn Bioshock Infinite, you can only carry two weapons at a time. While adding to the strategy of fire fights, it also saves you money on ammo as you will only be aiming to fill up two weapons instead of six, or eight. You will never be unable to complete a part of the game because you have the wrong weapons though. Weapons can also be upgrade to decrease their spread, increase clip size, or increase the amount of damage they do. Infinite showcases a variety of weapons, all of which are useful for most situations. So if you run out of ammo for your carbine, and Elizabeth can''t find anymore ammo for it, don''t worry about dropping it to pick up a pistol laying on the ground. It''ll prove just as effective, only causing less damage and possibly making you rely on Vigors a little more heavily.\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/solidbatman/bioshock%20inifinite/605051_20130321_screen003_zps49bc31ec.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nThe gun play is fast paced and intense. With the Skylines above you dropping enemies, and varied enemy types coming at you, you will be forced to keep on the move and adapt to the situations. You won''t be able to get out of every situation by just spraying bullets everywhere. You will have to think on the fly (literally if you hop on the Skylines), and adapt as the situation calls for it. This keeps every firefight exciting and fresh as you figure out different ways to eliminate the enemies.\r\n\r\nBecause the action is so intense, its nice to have breaks now and then. The game provides this in what are usually character development stretches. During the time between gun battles, Booker and Elizabeth will just talk and explore the city on their way to their goal. Some of the buildings in Columbia are accessible and hide some valuables inside that will aid you. You will also come across locked doors. If you have enough lock picks on you, Elizabeth can pick the locks and open the doors for you. Again, you''ll find plenty of goodies in Columbia, and you are encouraged to explore. Elizabeth will sometimes even point out areas to explore. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae324/solidbatman/28633515_zpsce90111e.jpg[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nThe game moves along at a fairly brisk pace, never dragging out anyone sequence. While you will have to backtrack, a certain plot element keeps it feeling different and fresh when you do end up having to backtrack over areas. The only portion of the game, that I found to be a little bit slower was towards the middle of the game when you begin to learn more about a group called the Vox Populi. It still is interesting story material, but it became something of a side spectacle in my quest to learn more about the leaders of Columbia. \r\n\r\nWhen I was asked what I thought of Bioshock, I told a coworker it was a good, fun game. When he asked about Bioshock Infinite, I told him it was a masterpiece, and easily one of the five best games I have ever played. The story is unmatched in terms of scope and writing by nearly every western gaming studio out there. The setting of Columbia is the most interesting, rich setting I have ever seen in any video game, and the Skylines that the setting provides, add a very fun wrinkle to the game. The team at Irrational gaming has delivered a game in which FPS fans can finally get the story RPG fans love so much; a rich, in depth story filled with fully fleshed out characters and plot twists that will get your mind thinking. If you come into this game looking for a generic shooter, or a formulaic game, then you are in for a shock. \r\n\r\nBioshock Infinite might just be the peak of this generation of gaming. No video game is perfect, but what Ken Levine and his team at Irrational Games have done with Bioshock Infinite might be the closest thing I''ve ever seen. Infinite''s triumphs far, far outweigh it''s very few, and minor flaws. And because of that, I am about to do something I''ve never done for a video game before.\r\n\r\n[u][b]Overall: [/u]10/10[/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n', 2208, 16, '2013-05-13 04:58:02', 46, 'no', ':46:16:2:1:9:1:55', 'Bring us the girl, wipe away the debt.

(2212, 'Indie Game Spotlight: Unhack', 'Welcome to Indie Game Spotlight! In this semi- regular series (pretty much whenever I get around to playing games), I''ll be spotlighting a small indie games that I come across. I''m not looking for the big ones, like Minecraft or Fez. Instead, I will be searching the vast world of the internet to find small, unheralded indie games. These type of games are usually come from a small team of passionate video game enthusiasts, that is, if there is a team at all. \r\n\r\nToday, I will be taking a look at Unhack, a game by InvertMouse, with music by Matt from Brainfed. Unhack is a visual novel with puzzle/adventure gameplay written in HTML 5. In it, you take the role of an Unhacker working for Smack Security to eliminate the 5K Worms that infest computers across the world. Nothing, except an Unhacker can get rid of these worms. Not even wiping a hard drive can get rid of them. Luckily, the Unhacker is not left alone. In the game, you have an AI ally, Weedy. She guides you and offers plenty of tips to completing a mission, as well as proving a fun, reliable companion as you uncover the 5K Worm mysteries. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/iDrKhTs.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nAs you go about your quest, you learn more about Weedy, and the other AIs that either assist you, or try to stop you. The banter between the Unhacker and Weedy always brings a smile to my face as they constantly bicker and pick on each other. Our Unhacker is a cocky fellow as well, so he seems to enjoy making smart ass comments towards the AIs, which is usually met with the response you''d expect from them. \r\n\r\nThe game play of Unhack is simple, yet fun. You navigate a maze of sorts, by clicking marked areas of the maze. You can only move the an area that is directly connected to your marked spot. Along the way, you will have to dodge various hazards. Worms navigated the maze along a pre-determined path, certain parts of the maze have rotating obstacles, or laser beams that shoot out towards you. You have to time everything properly to make it through all of the hazards.There is no time limit, so you are free to move deliberately and take your time through the mazes.\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/Q1CpsRu.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nSomething that really stood out to me was the way in which new gameplay mechanics were introduced. Instead of holding your hand through a tutorial, Unhack instead throws the new mechanics at you, with only a small description of what the new mechanics do from Weedy. You really learn about them from seeing them in action. InverMouse took care to introduce the new mechanics by themselves at first, then slowly reintroducing the new mechanics as the level progressed. This results in you dodging everything by the end of the level, and never being overwhelmed. The game makes sure you learn, without ever explicitly teaching you or holding your hand. \r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/skuexhZ.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\nInvertMouse was kind enough to answer a few of my questions too, so enjoy a behind the scenes look into Unhack and the mind of InvertMouse!\r\n\r\n[b]What led to you wanting to create games?[/b]\r\n\r\n[i]IM: When I was little, I would often play a game, then jump onto pencil and paper to design my own levels. Guess I was just born with that interest. I spent around ten years studying storytelling in hopes of becoming a novelist. With indie game development becoming viable, I decided to jump on board and build some story focused games.[/i]\r\n\r\n[b]Can you go through the creation process for creating an episode of Unhack? How long does an episode typically take?[/b]\r\n\r\n[i]IM: An episode takes around two weeks to make. One if I exhaust myself. Levels are designed first on paper, then roughly sketched out on wacom before being finalized. Throughout this process, I would write the episode''s script and apply it onto the level. The entire plot was structured before I began episode one. The last step is play testing and making refinements.[/i]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/zcRsY23.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[b]Was there any particular source of inspiration for Unhack or its characters?[/b]\r\n\r\n[i]IM: Unhack was originally going to be named "System Settings". The game was going to take place inside an OS interface where you''re guided by AI mascots. Those were inspired by the OS-tan from Japan''s version of Windows, etc. That evolved into the Unhack we see today.[/i]\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/vFlvFHL.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[b]What do you hope for the future of Unhack? What happens once you finish Unhack?[/b]\r\n\r\n[i]IM: Once all ten episodes are finished, I hope to convert Unhack into an iPad app. I plan to add new scenes, difficulties, etc. When the project is finished, I will start building my next game.[/i]\r\n\r\n[b]One thing that impressed me about Unhack was the level design. How did you go about creating a level, and deciding what worked and what didn''t?[/b]\r\n\r\n[i]IM: It''s mostly about drawing from past failures. Play testing by other players is important, too. They will always spot things the creator fails to see.[/i]\r\n\r\n[b]The internet can be a nasty, mean place. How do you handle criticisms?[/b]\r\n\r\n[i]IM: I try to take some time off before replying to avoid getting emotional. If you respond nicely, most of the time, people will do the same. Otherwise, well, those people are unworthy of your time, anyway. I also consider that the person in question could be young. In that case, I try to let it go.[/i]\r\n\r\n[b]What advice would you give to aspiring game developers out there?[/b]\r\n\r\n[i]IM: Have fun and maintain a balanced lifestyle. Building a game is a lot of work. Being happy is the best way to stay motivated.[/i]\r\n\r\n[b]And the most important question today, will Weedy every try the costume mods!?[/b]\r\n\r\n[i]IM: Weedy said she will think about it![/i]\r\n\r\nInvertMouse plans to have 10 episodes of Unhack, with 6 being avaiable right now. Episode 7 is set to be released on May 18th, so go try Unhack out. It''s a fun, simple game with charm, a good story and solid gameplay mechanics. And its developed by one guy. Pretty impressive in my book.\r\n\r\nYou can try Unhack for yourself [url=http://unhack.invertmouse.com/#index.html]by clicking here![/url]\r\n\r\nYou can also follow InvertMouse on Twitter [url=https://twitter.com/InvertMouse]@InvertMouse[/url], or check out his website [url=http://www.invertmouse.com/]here[/url].\r\n\r\nA big thank you to InvertMouse for allowing me to interview him!\r\n', 2212, 16, '2013-05-16 17:13:38', 46, 'no', ':16:9:2:46:1:1:55', 'Stop the 5K Worms, Do it for the costume mods', '2013-05-16 17:13:38', 0, 0, 0, 0, 16, 55, '', '', 'no', '', '', ''),

This is adding bells and whistles to an industry standard and acting like you just invented it. Microsoft didn''t bring anything new to the table. \r\n\r\nWhat ultimately matters is the games, and how you play them.

The 360 had a ton of exclusives that weren''t worth a damn. Like I said, I don''t care about the extra things. Its nice to have them, but will they make or break my buying of the system? Nope. The games will, and Microsoft didn''t show anything that wowed me or made me think I would need to buy the One.\r\n\r\nCompare that to Sony which brought numerous first and third party developers onto the stage. We saw Square Enix, Sucker Punch, Capcom, indie developers, among others. Sony also released a massive list of development teams for the PS4, and from looking at it, I can safely say at least half are working on exclusives.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft on the other hand had EA Sports, Microsoft Studios, and Infinity Ward. The track record for Microsoft has left a lot to be desired as a gamer who values games above all things. \r\n\r\nI wasn''t impressed in anyway by the Xbox One. While I wasn''t too impressed by the PS4 either, its obvious to me Sony is still in the business of making the words "video game" in video game console its priority. Everything in Sony''s conference revolved around the games, and what you could do. Half of Microsoft''s conference was dedicated to entertainment. \r\n\r\nSony has created a video game console, where video games are the focus. I think all the extra things are pointless. I can press one button and be back to watching TV. I can press another button and be listening to music. I can already do all that. The One didn''t show anything new. \r\n\r\nAs for always Online, certain games may require it, but not the console itself (not different from this generation).

(2249, 'Re: Xbox Reveal', 'No, calling a console The One is pretty silly sounding to be honest. \r\n\r\nAnd I see almost no one defending this console except the die hards. Microsofts stock has dropped, while Sony''s has increased around 10% at this point. It''s pretty much universal opinion that Microsoft failed in spectacular fashion in exciting people for this entertainment box. They delayed this conference a whole month to respond better to Sony and this is the steaming pile of shit they gave us. They would have been better served to simply wait until freaking E3 to show off the new console. \r\n\r\nThe Xbox One doesn''t seem like a next gen console. Its like Xbox 360 3.0. There is no innovation on it that relates to gaming what so ever. Everything the One does, has already been done. Meanwhile Sony adds a share button, makes indie development easier than ever before, DOESN''T CHARGE EXTRA TO PLAY USED GAMES, and as usual, shows off a much better library of GAMES!\r\n\r\nBecause thats what these are supposed to be.

It really doesn''t sound like it will totally cripple the console.\r\n\r\nAnd i don''t get why you seem so upset about this whole thing Bats, Sony just went in one direction while Microsoft went in another. Sony is focusing on gaming first and foremost, while Microsoft is aiming for a much wider audience. \r\nBut from what i understand, the Xbox One will still do the most important thing with It''s games: It will bring Xbox users 8th Generation games. Not a whole lot more at this point, but it will do that at least. Sony will bring it''s users 8th Generation gaming and more, but not a whole lot else.\r\n\r\nAt this point, Sony has it''s gaming innovations and focus going for them, and It will probably appeal mainly to the core or hardcore gamer fanbases. Microsoft has gaming, TV, Music and some other stuff going for them, and they may have bit off more than they can chew, but only time will tell. As it stands right now, I''m in favor of the One; It gives me the chance to play 8th Generation games, and that''s all i want. Sony is sticking to the formula that has worked for decades, but the way i see it Microsoft is exploring what else a single console can do.\r\n\r\nWhat happens if at E3 Sony just shows more games? Just more of all things gaming related? If all you ever wanted from a console is games, and nothing more that''s your console. \r\nMicrosoft will show a lot of new things at E3, including new games, and all the extra stuff as well. Xbox One is just exploring a wider consumer base, while possible losing some in the gaming community.\r\n\r\nTo sum up my stance; Sony is staying true to the old formula, Games first. I have no problem with it, and I am very much still on the fence about which console to invest in.\r\nMicrosoft is trying new things, focusing less on some areas and trying to win more in others, and I don''t see anything wrong with that.\r\n\r\nWhy shouldn''t our gaming consoles try to evolve beyond a single task?', 2239, 9, '2013-05-21 23:23:41', 46, 'yes', '', '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 'no', '', '', ''),
(2251, 'Re: Xbox Reveal', 'That "always online" thing really is a bad idea...yes, the console doesnt always have to be online, but for once a day, it has to be. So, what will happen if it isn''t on? We don''t know...and that worrys me. Microsoft must know the gaming communities hatred for things that are "always online." So revealing that a check will happen once-a-day, without explaining it any further, really hindered their progress of gaining support from the gaming community. \r\n\r\nSo what will happen when I lose my connection due to a network difficulty, and the check happens at that point? Will I get penalized? So far, we dont know, and that fact is making people worried. If there is any sort of penalization, then Microsoft shall lose a lot of customers, and their image will plunge. \r\n\r\nNow, I understand what Microsoft is planning to do with this console...they want to make it an all entertainment system. Is this wrong? No. They can put whatever they want out into the market. Now, what i do not agree with them, is their claim of innovation. I hardly see anything that is a major innovative experience. While watching the live press release, I heard and saw nothing but bells and whistles. The xbox 360 and PS3 can do all that...you can watch movies, go to FB, listen to music, and play games. As Solidbatman said, Xbox One is just Xbox 360 2.0.\r\n\r\nNow, you say they are innovating the console like the phone, to not make it into only a Video Game console, but a full entertainment one. But...if a phone cannot do the basic service of making a phone call reliably, then it doesnt matter what else it has. If Microsoft doesn''t make that portion work, then they failed at making the next generation console. Now, imagine this, on a Console release conference, they spent half of it, talking about the ability to watch TV, which you need another device for! Which they failed to mention! They also spent a quarter of it, talking about CoD: GHOSTS. A game released on most consoles...really? Just say that the Xbox One will have exclusive DLC content, and that is it...dont spend that much time talking about a game that isnt an exclusive. \r\n\r\nPaying a "small" fee to play used games? How small is small? Now, what about their fees to go to Xbox Live? Their fees to use their exclusive live streaming for sports? I had the Xbox 360 from the first year it came out till the beginning of August of 2012...and I must say, their Microsoft Points are not cheap, nor is Xbox Live. \r\n\r\n" Why shouldn''t our gaming consoles try to evolve beyond a single task?" -Absalon\r\n\r\nSony is trying to do that as well. Now, for the PS4, you have the ability to watch videos, listen to music and social network. Same thing what the Xbox One will do, but...with a few other bells and whistles. \r\n\r\nBut, I must say, it is still a bit early to be trashing Xbox One to the full extent of our abilities...we must wait till E3 for more information about the console. But for what we have been shown so far, it is an utter failure in the world of gaming. PS4 release conference gave us enough info to say that, Sony, has indeed brought a next generation console.

You don''t like what X1 offers, nobody is forcing you to get one. \r\n\r\nTo reiterate mine and Tim Buckleys point; The gaming aspect of the X1 and PS4 are a given. Of course they''re going to have games, and of course those games are going to be next generation. They are still gaming consoles.\r\nWhat Sony did in their presentation was focus on what gaming is like on the PS4, what Microsoft did is show what [i]else[/i] the next generation of consoles can do. It''s two different focus areas, but they are still more or less the same.\r\n\r\nThink about it, E3 is in a few weeks, so why would Microsoft show all the gaming related stuff first, when It''s already a given that they have it? Wouldn''t it make more sense to get into the gaming details at [i]the[/i] gaming convention? \r\nOf course Microsoft will show us more games, and what else the console is capable of, but why hate them so intently just because they want to show us that a console do other stuff too? It''s been a day since the announcement, and people are already calling the TV related stuff a deal breaker, without even having seen Microsofts full menu?\r\n\r\nGamers are saying any of the following is deal breakers; fee for used games, too much TV, not enough games and all such things. But are they forgetting that consoles grow and adapt during their lifetime? Look at the Xbox 360 when it first launched, and look at what it is now. It''s actually very different, it offers more of everything instead of staying focused on a single thing. Both Microsoft and Sony will adapt their consoles according to feedback, It''s not like everything Microsoft or Sony says is already set in stone, the fee to play used games, the sometimes online thing, all of that can change according to what their consumers want from them, yet gamers are swearing off everything Microsoft has offered in one day. \r\n\r\nI''m kind of sad that so many gamers appear so shortsighted, only focusing so harshly and negatively on what was said in the course of a single day, instead of just cutting back, and letting Microsoft present their full ideas.', 2239, 9, '2013-05-22 17:06:40', 46, 'yes', '', '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '', 'no', '', '', ''),

(2258, 'Re: Xbox Reveal', 'No, what I''m upset about is that the focus seems to be getting lost in glitter and crayons. Microsoft really focused on the casual audience, while ignoring the core of their audience. I understand E3 is coming up, so I''m also upset on how poorly Microsoft chose to date this conference. I''m also upset because Microsoft delayed their conference a month and this is what we got. I was expecting them to come out swinging, aiming for the top again, and trying to outdo Sony. Instead, I got to watch them talk about watching TV through an Xbox instead of... well... my tv.\r\n\r\nSo I''m furious, because I see gaming consoles becoming irrelevant as a gaming console. This is the beginning of the pandering. It''s fine to try and gain a new audience, but I felt like Microsoft ignored the gaming audience. \r\n\r\nLook, it may not matter to you guys because you guys don''t play the same style of games I play. You guys want functionality, you guys want glitter and extra stuff. Thats fine, but people like me were ignored by Microsoft. People like me wanted to see a step forward in terms of gaming, not in terms of living room family entertainment. I wanted to see Microsoft step out and show an interest in the rest of the world. All those cool things will only be available to the US. No, Europe or Japan are not getting HBO, ESPN, or anything like that now. The entire conference was US driven. It ignored the rest of the world. \r\n\r\nE3 may really change my mind, and I may eat every last one of my words if Microsoft comes out swinging and charging headfirst into a sea of innovative, third party exclusives. But based on the track record, and the focus of the latest conference, I find it hard to believe that Microsoft is going to really do this. I feel like we''ll see the same thing we always see. Sports, Call of Duty, Kinect, and some random, non gaming feature (Xbox TV in this case). \r\n\r\nSo I''m mad because I expected so much more from them. I''m mad because I see a terrible trend taking place. I''m mad because as a gamer, I felt ignored. I''m overreacting I''m sure, but gaming is my number one past time. I would love to become a gaming journalist. I know most gaming related news before 99% of my friends. I try to keep up with every genre out there, even the ones I don''t care about personally.

I don''t want to see a second industry crash, but signs are pointing towards it happening, and I see similarities to the 1983 crash. Xbox One may turn out to be an incredible system, but I saw nothing that gave me any hope for it. If you remember, I was disappointed by the PS4, but reserved most of my judgement.

(2262, 'Re: Xbox Reveal', 'I can''t remember if i mentioned it, but your current Gamerscore will be transferred to the X1.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nI think I''d like to offer my criticisms of the X1, now that I''ve had some time to digest it all.\r\n\r\nNote that i am no where near as hateful or disappointed as the rest of the internet is. It''s far, far too early to hate the X1 or Microsoft for anything they''ve announced.\r\n\r\nThat being said, my concerns are about the following:\r\n\r\n1. The TV stuffs. I am not against having my Xbox working as my cable box as well as my gaming console. But, a lot of what Microsoft has announced at previous E3''s has almost always been aimed mainly at, or been exclusive to the US, and not even all of the US, Hawaii just gets no love. And as a European, I really hate the fact that Microsoft time and time again don''t do enough to encourage the markets outside the continental US.\r\nIf they give me the option to use the TV functions, I would take it. But If it''s just something that only certain parts of the US can use, I''ll be pretty fucking disappointed.\r\nAlso, the rumors that suggest you still have to have a cable box for it to work are downright stupid. Doesn''t that negate having that function in the Xbox completely? \r\n\r\n2. The Kinect. The voice commands are cool, and if they work as well as demonstrated this time around, I might even actually use them. \r\n"Xbox on", "Xbox watch TV", It''s nice and simple. Hell I''d say downright calming. No more searching for a remote or fiddling with the buttons, It''s a simple mechanic, and if it works, Fuck Right, well done.\r\nBut, I do not want my Xbox to be totally dependent on that device being connected. For practical reasons not everyone may have the required space for it to stand in a reasonable position, not everyone wants to use any of It''s functions, and they shouldn''t be forced to use it. \r\n\r\nTo summarize; I want the TV extras to work on an as global as possible scale, and not just the US. And I want less Kinect dependency.\r\n\r\nI am actually OK with the used games fee. I can see how it makes sense, lemme explain.\r\nYou go and buy a new game, and as the X1 requires you to install it onto your harddrive, you don''t need the disc after that. Now, people get upset here because they can''t simply "lend" that game to a friend for them to play, but with the X1, you aren''t really lending that game out; It''s linked to your account, It''s installed to your Xbox. Technically speaking you still possess that game. Your friends do not. They have not paid for the game you have just given them to play. I can see the logic in that, seeing as you never really forfeit the game you own, and whoever borrows it haven''t bought the rights to play it in the first place, I can see why there would be a fee. It''s like an upgraded new games policy.\r\nGranted I don''t usually buy used games, in fact off the top of my head i can recall 2 used games i own. But i know, and fully understand that a lot of gamers operate on a budget, that might not allow them to always pay full price for a new title.

He wants to take the fight to the Titans before that can happen.\r\n\r\nAttack on Titan has the most twists and turns I''ve seen from any anime in a long time.

(2282, 'A Really Big Change', 'Hey guys, it''s been a while. Yesterday I got to thinking something: we''re pretty big on Minecraft. Almost all of us are on there on the server, and those of us that aren''t, simply lack the capabilities of getting on (I wont call out any names [solidbatman], don''t worry). But anyway, (and think before you blurt out at me in rage or what-have-you), what would you think about turning DreamSpand into a Minecraft-site? I could redo the boards and everything, and I could make a sub-board to store all of our current topics and posts so that they don''t get lost forever. I''m working on an example on my computer and I figure content will be much, MUCH easier to work on that way because it will be all Minecraft/Tekkit/FTB/Big Dig/Big Reactors/Voltz/etc. I think our main problem, which is something that you guys have said before, is that we''re too generalized. I understand things taking a while to get started sometimes, but it''s been over a year. It''s time to do something different. I would redo the homepage and everything...again...but that''s okay, it will be much easier to implement things if it''s based off of one subject. And there again, sites based off of one particular subject are my specialty, it''s why my last sites flourished so well. And the best part about that, is that they were built and themed around something called chao, which have admittedly been dead for at least 10 or so years, yet they still had over two thousand members each. One of them, the one I made from scratch, had over 5,000 at one point, in just a couple of years. I had managed to reach 100 members before six months even came, and 1,000 members within a year.\r\n\r\nSo if we make this site about something that''s still very much alive, it will be twice that. We''ll have a much bigger and better purpose, and I do believe things will be a heck of a lot easier. I''ve talked with Michael about it and he said it sounded good, but I''m not one to just suddenly make a change without telling you guys about it first. I want to hear your thoughts, so tell me what you think: if you''re for it or against it, what kind of changes you think we''d need to make or what changes NOT to make, etc. I''ve already got a new skin made on my computer that I''m still working on. And imagine the modders that would bring stuff here - we could be the home site for the next big mod. There''s so many possibilities, and it really wouldn''t be that difficult to do. I mean, think about it, the site''s dead as a doornail. It has been for a while. We''re lucky if we get three people on in a day. Let''s put it out of its misery so something new can be born.

(2354, 'Update: Return of The Old Server', 'Automatic update was made by: [user=1][br][br]Yep, that''s right folks, the old Minecraft server will soon be returning! We have been working on it diligently, setting up permissions, warps, RPGs, Citizens, etc. The three original worlds will return, including the kingdom world. More worlds will also be featured, including a "Jungle Law" world. This world will be the new default spawn for new players. It will be a rule-less, limitless map for newbies, and it will be on Hard mode. Players can run wild in this world and do whatever. However, permissions [i]will[/i] still apply. In order for these players to access the other worlds, they have to:\n\nA.) Locate the portal for each individual world. They are scattered across the map and always look different (some are made of diamond, some are laying down, etc.)\n\nB.) Have the [b]Members[/b] permission group. Players will be watched for a while, and usually within a week or two, will be upgraded to Member status so that they may go from world to world.\n\nAll of the original plugins are back that we had before, including the head drops. More plugins have also been added and configured. Mobs will have the chance to drop their spawn eggs on death now, rather than [i]just[/i] their heads. Also for ops and admins is an NBT editor, so that zombie and skeleton horses are in the game. The Citizens plugin is back, with two trait classes: Sentry and Builder. Builder is still being explored, but the Sentry plugin works beautifully, and will be used to construct "Boss Towers," where members will fight regular mobs in a dungeon-like arena, then fight the Sentry boss at the top. Sentries will also be used to guard certain structures from griefers and mobs.\n\nWorldEdit and WorldGuard are also back, as well as Dynmap and BiomeEdit. Regular members will still not be able to use these plugins unless in they''re in the creative world (this is a work in progress, however).\n\nThe Kingdoms world will be turned into Adventure RPG map, similar to an MMO. This world (as well as the survival map) will feature The Four Swords of Triumph, using the RPG Items plugin like before. The four swords are: Diablo, Thor, Glacius and Ender (a topic referring to these swords and what they do can be found in the Vault board). They will feature all of their powers from the last time that they made an appearance.\n\nFear not, the Tekkit server will still be active. It is still constantly up. We''re just looking to host the regular Minecraft 1.6.2 server again. We believe we''ve found a decent host, but we''re still looking, just to see all of our options. Right now the Minecraft server is hosted on Hamachi on Mike''s computer, so it''s not exactly ideal for mass play just yet.\n\nSo just stick with us, and we''ll have more stuff headed your way![br][hr]This post was automatically made when the update was posted.

We''re back, and a lot of the security holes have been fixed. We won''t go into detail about what they are or what they do, but if you''re one of my buddies on Skype, then feel free to ask me about it! A lot of strong encryption and further secure measures have been implemented to prevent something like what happened before, from happening again. Further hacking or attempted exploitation of the site or any of its resources [b]will[/b] result in law enforcement involvement - a quick laugh is just not worth the risk.\n\nSo since I''ve been adding this new security (and I''m still adding more), I''ve also been working on the site and improving it more. Once we get our Minecraft 1.6.2 server live, this site is bound to have a [i]lot[/i] of activity. Anyway, I plan on adding more features and security over the timespan of the next few weeks. \n\n[b]Note: [/b] Once you first arrive to the site, it will give you an error message about "detecting invalid cookie data." This is perfectly normal, so long as it only displays [i]once[/i]. Simply log in again and you should be good, as long as you don''t tamper with the set cookies of the web site. Any slightest change in them at all will result in that error message, and upon three times of getting the message, you are permanently auto-banned. Once you log in, make sure you change your passwords and security questions!!!! This is extremely important, I can''t stress how much. Keep in mind, however, that in order to change your password, you MUST have a security question set! The site will disallow it otherwise, for security reasons. You also have the option of resetting your password now, instead of having it e-mailed to you. This way, no one can know what password you have set.\n\nEnjoy the site, and let us know if you need anything.

So I went in and did something different, that I spent all day doing today. First of all, some of you know that I''ve been modding Minecraft for a few months now. I have four of my own mods added on to this new server, the [b]AlphaPack Server[/b]. It''s my very first mod pack. However, it''s not just my mods. There are [i]many other[/i] mods added on to it, including (but not limited to) GalactiCraft, ComputerCraft, Twilight Forest, Modular PowerSuits, MineFactory-Reloaded, MystCraft, BuildCraft, and many, many more.\n\nNote: This is not Tekkit. It is regular 1.6.4 Minecraft with the 1.6.4 version of Forge.\n\nYou can download the full AlphaPack mod pack here: http://www.dreamspand.com/mods/AlphaPack.zip\n\n[b]Part One - Mod Files[/b]\n1.) Extract the zip file\n2.) Take all of the mods out of the "mods" folder in the zip file\n3.) Put them inside your mods folder in %appdata% -> .minecraft -> mods\n4.) Done!\n\n** Install these mods in your "mods" folder in your .minecraft folder under AppData. \n\nAlso, download this one as well:\nhttp://www.dreamspand.com/config.zip\n\nDue to compatibility issues, some IDs were changed to allow them to work together. This means that you need to replace the config files with the newly changed IDs.\n\n[b]Part Two - Config Files[/b]\n1.) Extract the zip file\n2.) Copy the "config" folder to %appdata% -> .minecraft\n3.) This should replace the necessary files\n4.) Done!\n\n** Replace your "config" folder with this after unzipping it or you may have ID errors.\n\nIf you need further assistance, please, don''t hesitate to post about it or message a staff member. We''ll get back to you as soon as we can, either way, and we''ll be happy to help. Once all of the mods are installed, you can join the server.\n\nThe IP for the AlphaPack Server is: 192.227.248.110:47407\n\nPaste that in the Server IP portion when you click on Add Server. \n\nAlso, the Tekkit worlds are not "gone", they''ve just been decommissioned temporarily. However, we did purchase a new server host today, or rather Mike did. We have twice the gigs and half the price. We''re still setting it up, but that''s where our Tekkit worlds went.

Shares all traits and qualities of spiders, and for now, drops the same things.[/*]\n[*]New passive/aggressive mob - Zombie Hogman. Hogs transform into this when struck by lightning. Slightly faster than Zombie Pigman, and hit a little bit harder. Spawn naturally in the Nether. Shares all traits and qualities of its cousin.[/*]\n[*]Ghost Changes - Slightly more health and damage. Plays a sound when invisible. Stays invisible for longer periods of time. AI slightly improved and more efficient.[/*]\n[*]Shark Changes - Now spin around instead of being constantly still.[/*]\n[*]Fixed issue with rare spawn - now all new mobs have a higher chance of spawning.[/*]\n[/list]\n\n[b]Mega Biomes[/b]\n[list]\n[*]New Biome - Magma Slime Lands. Very similar to Slime Lands. Made up of magma slime blocks. Causes vertical bouncing and inflames any entity that walks on it. Magma Slimes spawn wildly in this biome. Magma Slimes can be crafted into 9 magma creams, and then back again.[/*]\n[*]Redrock Furnace - No different than a regular furnace, other than aesthetics. Created from Redrock Stone.[/*]\n[*]Slime Block Changes - No longer deals fall damage as long as you land on a slime block.[/*]\n[*]Removed Lilac from creative tab list.[/*]\n[/list]\n\nBe sure to get these updates so that you can play on the Alpha server.

These shells are basically a new individual, with their own inventory, experience level, and even gamemode.\r\n    However, what they lack, is a mind to control them. That’s where the player comes in. Each shell is biometrically tied to the player who’s sample is used to create it, and will allow the player to “sync” their mind to the other shell, essentially creating multiple player instances.\r\n    Place a shell constructor down and right click it to provide a sample (warning, this hurts!). The shell constructor cannot work without power, so put a treadmill down next to it and lure a Pig or a Wolf to the center of the treadmill to generate Piggawatts. A lead will help out out with this (you will get it back). The shell constructor will begin building a shell.\r\n    Once the shell is constructed, you need to place down a shell storage unit and supply redstone power to it. The indicator will switch to green and you can walk into the storage unit to activate it. You will see a radial menu pop up with the list of available shells and their positions. Select the shell in the constructor (labelled with the “Done” indicator) and watch as you are synced into the new shell.\r\n    Shell syncing works cross dimensional too! Get to the nether and back through a shell! However, you cannot enter or leave shells in The End due to…. technical difficulties.\r\n    By default, shells provide an “extra life” to the player. When the shell you are using dies, you will immediately resync to the nearest shell available. You can mark a preference shell by right clicking a storage unit with a bed, labelling it as a home storage unit. You can also name storage units with a name tag. This “extra life” feature works in Hardcore mode, so if you have an active backup shell you will not be forced to abandon a hardcore world, but instead resync to another shell.\r\n', 2469, 5, '2014-02-27 03:10:23', 49, 'no', ':5:1:2', 'OMFG', '2014-02-28 03:48:20', 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 12, ':1', '', 'no', 'AMAZING,', '', ''),

I currently have the Fluix Sword and the Fluix Pick both are pretty costly to make. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor this Tutorial you will need\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Redstone (about 3 stacks)\r\n[*]Diamonds (38 )\r\n[*]Blaze powder (64)\r\n[*]Pulverized obsidian (64)\r\n[*]Induction Smelter (1)\r\n[*]Energetic Infuser (depends how much power you have running through your circuit)\r\n[*] Pulverized Coal\r\n[*]Sulfur (not the block!)\r\n[/list]\r\n[color=fff000]*OPTIONAL* [/color] GLOWSTONE \r\n\r\n[color=000000]If you have [color=ff0000]Blaze Powder[/color] then skip this part![/color]\r\n\r\nOK first things first If you don''t have any Blaze powders then that is easy to fix. \r\nif you DO NOT have any Blaze Powder first thing you will need to do is put the Magma crucible and the Fluid Transposer Together and have the Fluid go in automatically using the Configuration option once the two machines are placed together.\r\n\r\nplace in a stack of Rdstone in the crucible. Now you will notice that the redstone is depleting and the little bar on the right is not gathering any redstone. well thats because you have it set to go into the transposer. If you check the transposer there you will see that the redstone is filling up the bar there. \r\n\r\nThe redstone there is now called Destabilized redstone. \r\n\r\nNow that you have destabilized redstone place a stack of glowstone and there you will start gaining some Blaze Powder. \r\n\r\nThat is how you make some Blaze powder.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWe need some Pyrotheum dust to make it \r\n\r\nplace the coal, blaze powder, sulfur, and redstone into a crafting table.\r\nTADAA! Pyrotheum dust.\r\n\r\nNow make a good 30 of it keep those in your inventory as we will need them later!\r\n\r\nnow do you remember on how to make the elecrtum blend? well make em! if not \r\nPulverized gold and pulverized silver\r\n\r\nnow that you have some electrum place those suckers in the Fluid Transposer and you will start noticing its making something well thats the Fluxed Electrum blend.\r\n\r\nnow for Each 2 Pyrotheum dust and 1 Fluxed Electrum Blend it will make the Fluxed Ingot.\r\n\r\n---------------------CONGRATZ for your first Fluxed Ingot!-------------------\r\n\r\nwe aren''t finished yet!\r\n\r\nwe need to make some obisidian rods to make the tools!\r\n\r\nfor this part you will need:\r\npulverized obsidian and blaze powder.\r\nnow this recipee isnt shapeless so you will need on pulverized obisidian on 2 ends. on on the top right and one on the bottom left, and place a blaze rod in between.\r\n\r\nwe arent done yet though!\r\n\r\nwe need some fluxed Crystals too!\r\n\r\njust do the same thing with the diamonds as we did to the Electrum and the Glowstone.\r\n\r\nand out will pop out some Fluxed Crystals. \r\n\r\nnow repeat the recipe for the Obisidian rods but this time instead of the pulverized obsidian, place the Fluxed Crystal.\r\nReplace the Blaze powder with the Obisidian Rod.\r\n\r\nyou will make the Infused Obsidian Rod. \r\n\r\nnow craft the tools you want to make by using the Flux ingots and the Infused Obsidian Rod.\r\n\r\nto power them up you must first fill it up with energy.

(2501, 'About DreamCraft', '[size=6]DreamCraft[/size]\r\n\r\nDreamCraft is a server that has been around since March 17th of 2013, and it''s been built on a lot. The main spawn area is in the world simply called [b]survival[/b], and you spawn in a town-like area. In this area are multiple shops:\r\n\r\n[b]Flower Shop[/b]\r\nA pink building off to the side of the starter villages. You can buy or sell any type of flower here.\r\n\r\n[b]Farmer''s Market[/b]\r\nA building made of hay that''s up pretty high, anything and everything farm-related goes there. This includes fish and tree saplings. You can even buy and sell flowers and seeds there. A great way to make money is to work on your own farm, then sell some of it to make a quick buck. The prices are also relatively cheap, in case you need a certain crop that you''re having trouble finding.\r\n\r\n[b]General Shop[/b]\r\nThis shop is a black building made up of coal blocks. You can buy and sell misc things here, including but not limited to diamonds, iron ingots, emeralds, gold, redstone, slime balls, gunpowder, string, and cooked food. \r\n\r\n[b]Hardware Store[/b]\r\nThis building, made of blue stained clay, is where you may buy any kind of tool, such as axes, pickaxes, shovels and hoes. You can also buy and sell clocks, compasses, flint and steel, empty maps and fishing rods.\r\n\r\n[b]Bakery[/b]\r\nA building made up of brown stained clay. You can buy anything baking-related, such as bread, flour, sugar and cake.\r\n\r\n[b]Fishing Hole[/b]\r\nA small fishing hut made of wooden planks. You can not only buy and sell fish here, but it has a dock where you may fish at. A new addition is the fisherman''s Hall of Fame. Catch a decent amount of fish and/or show us your high fishing skill and you could have your character''s mugshot put there.\r\n\r\n[b]Minerail Shop[/b]\r\nPretty self-explanatory, you can buy anything related to minecarts and minecart rails here. Very expensive.\r\n\r\n[b]Armory[/b]\r\nHere you can buy weaponry and armor, both for yourself and for your horse(s). \r\n\r\n[b]Brewery[/b]\r\nAn upside-down half-sphere, you can buy any brewery ingredient here, as well as cauldrons and brewing stands. Just watch out for Hazel, the shopkeeper; she''s not a people person.\r\n\r\n[b]Archery Practice[/b]\r\nHere you can practice your archery. Imagine that. You can also buy a bow and/or arrows. Each color of wool is worth another set of points. We have no plugin integrated for this yet, so you''ll have to keep score for yourself. Still, it''s a great way to improve your shooting.\r\n\r\n[b]Library[/b]\r\nYou can buy and sell books and paper. We just can''t sell the enchanted books, because 1.) that would just make things too easy and 2.) the way the shop works does not allow us to.\r\n\r\n[b]Bank[/b]\r\nDefinitely one of the most useful (and fancy) buildings, this is where you can deposit and/or withdraw in-game money or xp. Money (in-game) and xp that you store in the bank will accumulate interest every so often, thereby increasing your funds. You can also check the balance of either one of them. Inside, there is a sign that you can right click called "Chatinteract", and it will let you manually decide what to do with your account via the chat. Type "quit" when you''re done with this mode. It also has a "drive-through" section on the side of the building, for quick access.\r\n\r\n[b]Headegg Shop[/b]\r\nThis building may seem a little strange. You can buy and sell [i]certain[/i] mob heads here. You also may buy or sell any type of spawn egg. Note, however, that not every spawn egg can be bought, and not every spawn egg can be sold. Things would get out of hand really quickly if we allowed people to buy Creepers and Wither Skeletons, let''s face it, folks.\r\n\r\n[b]Portals[/b]\r\nIn the back of the spawn point are MV portals that will take you to the designated biome on their signs, VERY far away. This is to allow players to build far and wide, instead of everyone living right close to each other. More portals will be added, but this way less resources are used up, and much less quickly. It provides an easy, efficient way for users to spread themselves apart.\r\n\r\n[b]TP Blocks[/b]\r\nThere is a section near the exit of Spawn made up of purple stained clay, and in this section, you will find numerous command blocks, preset with the teleportation command and the coordinates of peoples'' homes. This allows whoever wants one of these blocks, to tp to their home instantly, without the need of OP assistance. If you would like your own TP Block, please ask a staff member on the site or OP on the server, and we will be more than happy to add one for you. NOTE, however, that if this system is abused, the abuser will be kicked permanently from the server. Don''t harass or stalk people. Don''t go into their homes without their permission or follow them without their knowledge. That is not okay. You are free to go to and from your own home at your leisure, however, so long as you''re not spamming it. Also, if you should ask for a TP Block, you may also have one installed in your home, as a quick-access tp back to Spawn. \r\n\r\nThe Spawn point isn''t the only feature of the server, though it may be our most prominent. In the future, we intend to have multiple Spawn locations, and give each of them names. We also have plugins, one of them developed by yours truly, called BetaUtilities (though in the game it will simply say "beta" for now). This system allows players to set and use warps at their leisure. Again, so long as this system is not abused, it is free and open to all players.\r\n\r\n[b]Usage: [/b]\r\n/setwarp <warpName> - Allows you to set the specified warp. If this warp is previously set, it will overwrite the previous warp''s coordinates with the new one''s, rather than setting a new warp.\r\n\r\n/warp <warpName> - Warps the Player to the specified warp.\r\n\r\n/listwarps - Lists all available warps.\r\n\r\n[OP-Only]\r\n/delwarp <warpName> - Deletes the specified warp from the list.\r\n\r\n[size=4][b]Fun-Facts of DreamCraft Server[/b][/size]\r\n* When Creepers explode, they don''t damage the terrain - only Players. So no more losing your house.\r\n\r\n* When Players die, they do not lose their inventory. They will respawn with all of their items and their XP.\r\n\r\n* There are two other worlds, creative and kingdom. Only the first is open right now and can be reached from the TP Room. Each world and game-mode has its own separate inventory for each Player. This makes it easier to travel less confusingly from one world to the next, or previous, depending on your outlook of things.\r\n\r\n* We''ve had the server and its worlds since the 1.5.2 update.\r\n\r\n* When the plugin works correctly with updates, we have the NPC plugin called Citizens, and NPCs are at shops. They can also be conversed with.\r\n\r\n* The Spawn Town is protected against everything.\r\n\r\n* Although most structures were built, about 5% of them are schematics that have been found and implemented.\r\n\r\n* Some buildings were saved as schematics before/after game updates, then re-pasted after the fact to conserve them.\r\n\r\n--\r\nThis article will be updated as needed.

If not, contact one of us and we''ll help you. Also, removing them will substantially improve loading time and reduce a good amount of in-game lag. It''s not a requirement to remove them, but definitely a recommendation.\r\n\r\n[b]Added[/b]\r\n[url=http://www.dreamspand.com/mods/AlphaItems1.4.zip]Alpha''s Extras 1.4[/url]\r\n\r\nClick on the mods to download them. For assistance, talk to any staff member or OP. These days, adding and/or removing mods could not be easier. It''s really easy once you learn how, and this will probably be one of the last mod updates. I could be wrong about that though, it all depends on who asks to add what. We''ll check with the users first, though, to see what they think. The Tekkit server has grown substantially well, and we''re looking to expand it further, not shrink it more! So feel free to tell your friends and we''ll try to make things work. There may be maintenance on the server this week, but we''ll try our best to do it when either not a lot of people are on, or more than likely, no one at all. But don''t let it hinder your game-play! We have two other servers as well, although one is very glitchy (a hand-modded server with a manual modpack, called the Alpha Pack server, more of a ''testing'' area than anything else for mods / plugins).\r\n\r\nI''ve also removed all bans from the regular server, I think enough time has passed and things have calmed down enough. Well, I''ve cleared it except for one user, but nobody I''ve talked to in the past few months knows him but me. Someone I''ve had problems with for years, on sites and servers. He''s been very destructive and ill-mannered, arguing with users constantly and consistently breaking things built by other players with this pathetic little posse. But that''s it, everyone else is off. I figured I''d let everyone know.\r\n\r\nAlso! For those of you that are new, check the site regularly for updates. And I guess it''s time to release some news, seeing as how I''ve made some progress on this. In the not-too-distant future, your MC inventories will be synced with the web site. You will be able to buy things in-game with your tokens from here. You will be able to store and retrieve your inventory, and have different sets. Consider it as a sort of virtual storage for your things, especially with the mass amount of stuff on our servers. Tokens / in-game money will be the same thing, and will be connected through here, as well as the server. It''s a project I''ve been working on and thinking about for some time, and although I hit a dead-end with it the other night, I think I may have another path to go down with the Java coding I''m having to work with. \r\n\r\nAlso, yes, I update my mods, and the Alpha''s Items is (so far) the only one of my actual mods on the server, though I''ll eventually add my plugin too (that''s where the warps come from on the regular DreamCraft server, yours truly). Someone requested a turtle and wolf mod, and I''ve already got the model for the turtle made, the best I can with square designs...lol. It looks like the things from Spyro, it''s hilarious. But I think it looks okay. But I''ll only update my mods maybe once a month or so, unless I get asked to update them earlier. Also, if you have any ideas for mods (or a specific request in general), please feel free to ask. I really don''t mind, as long as I can do it, and if I can''t, I''ll tell you straight up. But that''s everything that''s going on right now. Have a good day everyone.\r\n\r\nThanks. :)[br][hr]This post was automatically made when the update was posted.

Likewise, when someone clicks our link from the other site, then our "hits in" for that particular site goes up by 1. This helps us track web traffic a little bit better and see how we''re doing on other web sites. Note that the site regularly checks its partners to see if the banner and link are there, and if it does not find them, the admins are notified about it and are prompted to take action (meaning deletion). Linking to each other is not a one-way-street.\n\nPlease, if you wish to link with us, send me an e-mail. I would be more than happy to talk about it, provided your e-mail is legible.

Seems that we have some funky business going on. First, I ran some traces on a couple hostnames that have been frequently visiting the site, but not posting or joining. The first one took me to a list of offensive IP addresses, and this one was from over in Japan. This one was banned now. Some of the "members" that have been signing up have also been robots in disguise (Transformers reference not intended). \r\n\r\nAside from that, while looking at the guest list I noticed something else: Mike and I, for whatever reason, shared the same IP today. While we basically live in the same neighborhood, he''s nowhere close to me and wasn''t at the time. I ran a trace on both of our IP addresses and it pointed to a city south of where we are, both times. I''m not entirely sure what''s going on, but I intend to find out. I advise changing your passwords and updating your security questions, if you have not already. I am deeply sorry for this inconvenience, and I promise the site isn''t harmful. The bots are just making it look that way. As far as our DreamSpand robot goes, well he''s a good bot, so don''t be mad at him. Also note that one of the main reasons that anti-virus programs may be marking this site is because of the numerous spam-bots that have been visiting us. There shouldn''t be any way your computer can get infected, as I wrote everything myself, so I wouldn''t worry too much. Just humor yourselves though and run some scans and checks just in case. Thanks.', '2012-10-05 03:40:09', 1),
(36, 'Limited Registration', 'Hey everyone, just letting you all know that I''ve turned on limited registration. What that means is that once someone signs up, the admins have to approve them before they can do anything. If we disapprove them, their accounts are instantly deleted. This is the first, small step towards preventing our spam-bot sign-ups. Users must also verify their e-mail now, before they can do anything on the site. I do plan to add more security checks so we can stop them from polluting our member list. I''ve deleted the "members" that were spam-bots and left the legit users.\n\nSorry for any inconvenience and I hope to have this fixed soon.', '2012-10-07 14:51:33', 1),

As a result though, nothing can auto-update anymore, at least not as quick or as often. I may try it again at some future date and I may not, it all depends. Hopefully when and if I do decide to try it again, they''ll have servers that will actually be worth something, and that can handle simple requests such as that.

I apologize for that, I was in a rush to get back to the hospital with my family and I had to beat lunch traffic, so there was that. Anyway, I''m down in the cafe for a minute so I can talk now. The main thing new is that the site is no longer just a forum - it is now a full-fledged, interactive web site of innovative gaming information. While we would like to provide as much user content as possible, please understand that we are short-staffed, and only staff and admins can add and edit pages and games. Halo 4 has been submitted already with every achievement available to read up on. Soon enough (hopefully early next year) we''ll be able to provide achievement videos for you, via our YouTube Channel, [link=http://www.youtube.com/user/LostAchievements]Lost Achievements[/link].\n\nAs for the other admins are various, site faculty members, please don''t hesitate to start adding games to pages, as well as making articles, reviews, gaming information pages, tips & tricks pages, etc. I will be able to help out shortly, but right now I have a lot of really, really important and life-changing stuff going on, so I hope you don''t mind starting without me. That''s one reason I released everything early: I wanted to make up for the slowness around here, at least some what. \n\nAs I said yesterday, the rest of the remodel will be released in bits and pieces. This is not finished by a long-shot. I understand it''s gonna take a little while to get used to a lot of this, it''s a lot to take in. Kinda surprised Mike, actually. If there''s anything you don''t like, let me know. Yes I worked very hard on this, but I need to focus on what the user (you) likes. \n\nThere have just been a lot of updates and improvements, mainly to the home page but I will be getting to the forums shortly. They are going to be very largely updated. As you can see, I''m not quite done with a lot of it. There''s bits and pieces of things here and there if you sit there and try to play with some of it. Again, let me know something and we''ll talk about it.\n\nI hope you guys like this so far, though. I''m sorry things are going kinda strange and slow right now, I''m just not real sure where my head''s at and I got a lot of things going on. But yeah, thank you for understanding. I hope things can go back to normal soon enough, and if not then either way I''ll still work on this place in my free time because it''s the only real distraction I have.\n\n-- Alpha', '2012-12-01 20:25:46', 1),

These include:\n\n1. [b]Citizens[/b] plugin. Ops can spawn NPC Players, great for roleplaying worlds. These NPCs can walk, talk, hold stuff, execute scripts, etc. We can even make carbon copies of other players.\n\n2. [b]LogBlock[/b] plugin. If a block is destroyed anywhere, it is logged in our SQL database. It will store who did it and what block it was, as well as the date and time of when it occurred. This will protect your creations.\n\n3. [b]Spawn[/b] plugin. This will allow you to spawn any entity, anywhere, up to 100. Please refrain from spawning in survival mode, and refrain from spawning any highly dangerous mobs at all. If you abuse this, you will be jailed and banned. Indefinitely on both accounts.\n\n4. [b]Notebook[/b] plugin. Lets admins and mods keep notes about specific users.\n\n5. [b]WorldEdit[/b] plugin. This one is way too much to explain, simply look it up if you want an explanation.\n\n6. [b]DynMap[/b] plugin. This is for the staff - we can view any part of the map from the browser and see absolutely everything going on.\n\n7. [b]WorldGuard[/b] plugin. This allows us to guard things from other people, from protecting blocks to disallowing even chest access.\n\n8. [b]BiomeEdit[/b] plugin. This will come in handy later and is currently also for the staff, but allows you to change a specified radius into the biome of your choosing.\n\n9. [b]Jail[/b] plugin. Use your imagination on this one - we can jail players for a certain amount of time, and all they can do is move around in their cell.\n\n10. [b]Multi-Verse[/b] plugin. This includes MVP Inventories (separate inventories for worlds) and MVP Portals (travel between worlds using our admin-made, GUARDED portals). \n\nThese are so far the only plugins we have, but that''s likely to change. We''re going to be working on a roleplaying world as well, featuring the NPCs and site-specific lore.\n\nWhen you first spawn in, you will enter Valhalla, a hand-made creation by SammyAxe / Absalon. This was before we had WorldEdit, and it is our most treasured building. It was built by hand in the first few days of opening the server, and it is beautiful. It''s based off of Nordic Mythology, and you will exit it through a rainbow bridge. To your left there will be a portal to the survival map - simply jump in to be teleported. Your inventory and equipment will change to its respective world when you do this. If you walk straight after you first spawn, you will see 10 rules in a row. Please read and obey them or we are going to have a problem. There is a guard walking around the rule signs, carrying a diamond sword. It is an NPC and yes, it is Master Chief from Halo (I named him Guard and the skin applied itself). \n\nThere are a whole lot of other things that you''re just gonna have to see - but don''t be a jerk, and don''t screw up anything that doesn''t belong to you. If you absolutely have to screw something up, then make something really, really nice and either mess it up yourself, or ask us to do it for you. We''ll be more than happy to destroy your crap if you''re the same towards us. Be respectful, and have fun. We currently have no issues or enemies, and I would like to keep it that way.

(78, 'Return of The Old Server', 'Yep, that''s right folks, the old Minecraft server will soon be returning! We have been working on it diligently, setting up permissions, warps, RPGs, Citizens, etc. The three original worlds will return, including the kingdom world. More worlds will also be featured, including a "Jungle Law" world. This world will be the new default spawn for new players. It will be a rule-less, limitless map for newbies, and it will be on Hard mode. Players can run wild in this world and do whatever. However, permissions [i]will[/i] still apply. In order for these players to access the other worlds, they have to:\n\nA.) Locate the portal for each individual world. They are scattered across the map and always look different (some are made of diamond, some are laying down, etc.)\n\nB.) Have the [b]Members[/b] permission group. Players will be watched for a while, and usually within a week or two, will be upgraded to Member status so that they may go from world to world.\n\nAll of the original plugins are back that we had before, including the head drops. More plugins have also been added and configured. Mobs will have the chance to drop their spawn eggs on death now, rather than [i]just[/i] their heads. Also for ops and admins is an NBT editor, so that zombie and skeleton horses are in the game. The Citizens plugin is back, with two trait classes: Sentry and Builder. Builder is still being explored, but the Sentry plugin works beautifully, and will be used to construct "Boss Towers," where members will fight regular mobs in a dungeon-like arena, then fight the Sentry boss at the top. Sentries will also be used to guard certain structures from griefers and mobs.\n\nWorldEdit and WorldGuard are also back, as well as Dynmap and BiomeEdit. Regular members will still not be able to use these plugins unless in they''re in the creative world (this is a work in progress, however).\n\nThe Kingdoms world will be turned into Adventure RPG map, similar to an MMO. This world (as well as the survival map) will feature The Four Swords of Triumph, using the RPG Items plugin like before. The four swords are: Diablo, Thor, Glacius and Ender (a topic referring to these swords and what they do can be found in the Vault board). They will feature all of their powers from the last time that they made an appearance.\n\nFear not, the Tekkit server will still be active. It is still constantly up. We''re just looking to host the regular Minecraft 1.6.2 server again. We believe we''ve found a decent host, but we''re still looking, just to see all of our options. Right now the Minecraft server is hosted on Hamachi on Mike''s computer, so it''s not exactly ideal for mass play just yet.\n\nSo just stick with us, and we''ll have more stuff headed your way!', '2013-07-23 20:27:37', 1),

A lot of strong encryption and further secure measures have been implemented to prevent something like what happened before, from happening again. Further hacking or attempted exploitation of the site or any of its resources [b]will[/b] result in law enforcement involvement - a quick laugh is just not worth the risk.\n\nSo since I''ve been adding this new security (and I''m still adding more), I''ve also been working on the site and improving it more.

This is perfectly normal, so long as it only displays [i]once[/i]. Simply log in again and you should be good, as long as you don''t tamper with the set cookies of the web site. Any slightest change in them at all will result in that error message, and upon three times of getting the message, you are permanently auto-banned. Once you log in, make sure you change your passwords and security questions!!!! This is extremely important, I can''t stress how much. Keep in mind, however, that in order to change your password, you MUST have a security question set! The site will disallow it otherwise, for security reasons. You also have the option of resetting your password now, instead of having it e-mailed to you.

This is also a safer way of storing your currency.[/*]\n[*]Site Cleanup[/b]. I''ve cleaned up a lot of stuff on the site and made it look prettier.\n[*][b]Request A Birthday Change[/b].

Plays a sound when invisible. Stays invisible for longer periods of time.

Very similar to Slime Lands. Made up of magma slime blocks. Causes vertical bouncing and inflames any entity that walks on it. Magma Slimes spawn wildly in this biome. Magma Slimes can be crafted into 9 magma creams, and then back again.[/*]\n[*]Redrock Furnace - No different than a regular furnace, other than aesthetics.

We''ll check with the users first, though, to see what they think. The Tekkit server has grown substantially well, and we''re looking to expand it further, not shrink it more! So feel free to tell your friends and we''ll try to make things work. There may be maintenance on the server this week, but we''ll try our best to do it when either not a lot of people are on, or more than likely, no one at all. But don''t let it hinder your game-play! We have two other servers as well, although one is very glitchy (a hand-modded server with a manual modpack, called the Alpha Pack server, more of a ''testing'' area than anything else for mods / plugins).\r\n\r\nI''ve also removed all bans from the regular server, I think enough time has passed and things have calmed down enough. Well, I''ve cleared it except for one user, but nobody I''ve talked to in the past few months knows him but me. Someone I''ve had problems with for years, on sites and servers. He''s been very destructive and ill-mannered, arguing with users constantly and consistently breaking things built by other players with this pathetic little posse. But that''s it, everyone else is off. I figured I''d let everyone know.\r\n\r\nAlso! For those of you that are new, check the site regularly for updates. And I guess it''s time to release some news, seeing as how I''ve made some progress on this. In the not-too-distant future, your MC inventories will be synced with the web site. You will be able to buy things in-game with your tokens from here. You will be able to store and retrieve your inventory, and have different sets. Consider it as a sort of virtual storage for your things, especially with the mass amount of stuff on our servers. Tokens / in-game money will be the same thing, and will be connected through here, as well as the server. It''s a project I''ve been working on and thinking about for some time, and although I hit a dead-end with it the other night, I think I may have another path to go down with the Java coding I''m having to work with. \r\n\r\nAlso, yes, I update my mods, and the Alpha''s Items is (so far) the only one of my actual mods on the server, though I''ll eventually add my plugin too (that''s where the warps come from on the regular DreamCraft server, yours truly). Someone requested a turtle and wolf mod, and I''ve already got the model for the turtle made, the best I can with square designs...lol. It looks like the things from Spyro, it''s hilarious. But I think it looks okay. But I''ll only update my mods maybe once a month or so, unless I get asked to update them earlier. Also, if you have any ideas for mods (or a specific request in general), please feel free to ask. I really don''t mind, as long as I can do it, and if I can''t, I''ll tell you straight up. But that''s everything that''s going on right now. Have a good day everyone.\r\n\r\nThanks. :)', '2014-05-06 19:29:08', 1),

I have completely scrapped the original and restarted from scratch, and so far I think it''s coming along pretty decent. I would post screenshots, but I kinda want it to be a surprise.

Currently, the mods, schematics, plugins and skins all function flawlessly, so they may be downloaded, edited, deleted (staff only), and added. They should be much easier to handle now, and everything is done on the same page, rather than having to load several new ones.
