[11/22/2012 10:33:52 AM] Alpha Wolf: oh aww that's sweet
[11/22/2012 10:34:04 AM] Alaris: Aww, you should definitely keep it.  It deserves a good home I'm sure.
[11/22/2012 10:34:16 AM] invader.mle: and it's like 3 1/2 months old
[11/22/2012 10:35:00 AM] Cjn14: Well, if it's a sweet kitten, I'm sure it wouldn't have trouble finding a good home at a humane society, if it had to come to that.
[11/22/2012 10:35:13 AM] Cjn14: My fam was in a similar situation this summer
[11/22/2012 10:35:19 AM] Alaris: If ya have to take it to a shelter though, make sure it's a no-kill shelter. >.<
[11/22/2012 10:35:21 AM] Alpha Wolf: don't be so sure =_= those places (around here at least) are demanding

[11/22/2012 10:35:51 AM] Christopher Kimble: DID I MISS SONIC THE HEDGEHOG
[11/22/2012 10:36:06 AM] Alpha Wolf: maybe, like I said around here in the country they're kinda demanding since they get animals all the time

[11/22/2012 10:36:35 AM] Alaris: Ah, hi then, Mykonos.

[11/22/2012 11:12:43 AM] Christopher Kimble: sadly
[11/22/2012 11:13:20 AM] Alaris: I'm sure he's not that irrelevent... who were we talking about again?
[11/22/2012 11:13:23 AM] Christopher Kimble: Mickey Mouse
[11/22/2012 11:13:39 AM] Christopher Kimble: AKA marketing character extravagant
[11/22/2012 11:14:01 AM] Christopher Kimble: ...oh how fitting
[11/22/2012 11:14:08 AM] Christopher Kimble: he's advertising the cruise lines in a sailor geddup

[11/22/2012 11:14:18 AM] Christopher Kimble: take some time to think
[11/22/2012 11:14:25 AM] Alaris: Not shocked here.
[11/22/2012 11:15:18 AM] Christopher Kimble: I shouldn't be talking about  marketing considering this entire thing is advertising....when did I become a grouch
[11/22/2012 11:15:36 AM] Alaris: *Nod* Yeah, but it's still fun to watch.
[11/22/2012 11:15:39 AM] Alaris: Even if it is advertising
[11/22/2012 11:15:58 AM] Cjn14: Muppets cast singing "What I am"

[11/22/2012 11:17:03 AM] Christopher Kimble: I'll get my Kermit fix
[11/22/2012 11:17:22 AM] Alaris: O.O
[11/22/2012 11:18:16 AM] Hunter: (pi)
[11/22/2012 11:18:35 AM] Christopher Kimble: I'd like a good pizza today
[11/22/2012 11:18:43 AM] Christopher Kimble: I don't like turkey all that much
[11/22/2012 11:19:27 AM] Alaris: You don't? Aww..

[11/22/2012 11:21:02 AM] Alaris: ^_^
[11/22/2012 11:21:06 AM] Christopher Kimble: Racing Transformed is very good by the way, if you're even remotely interested go give it a shot
[11/22/2012 11:22:10 AM] Alaris: Oh?  What's it for now?
[11/22/2012 11:22:21 AM] Alaris: Wii U I presume?
[11/22/2012 11:22:42 AM] Christopher Kimble: The Wii U version is apparently really broken at the moment
[11/22/2012 11:22:51 AM] Alaris: What other systems is it for?
[11/22/2012 11:22:52 AM] Christopher Kimble: But it's out for that, 360, PS3, and coming out for 3DS, Vita, and PC sooner or later
[11/22/2012 11:22:56 AM] Alaris: Oooh...
[11/22/2012 11:23:00 AM] Alaris: I might then
[11/22/2012 11:23:03 AM] Alaris: If it is good.
[11/22/2012 11:23:08 AM] Christopher Kimble: It's only 40 bucks if that helps
[11/22/2012 11:23:12 AM] Alaris: That does
[11/22/2012 11:23:17 AM] Alaris: I'm between jobs, so the cheapter, the better. ^_^
[11/22/2012 11:23:20 AM] Christopher Kimble: I grew up on SEGA stuff and loved the first game so naturally I love it
[11/22/2012 11:23:29 AM] Christopher Kimble: if you wanna wait a few months I'm sure the price will plummet eventually
[11/22/2012 11:23:47 AM] Alaris: Well, it's a modern Sonic Game that's NOT Generations.. the price will plummet soon enough.
[11/22/2012 11:24:04 AM] Alaris: [Sorry if that offended anyone... but yeah]
[11/22/2012 11:24:14 AM] Christopher Kimble: Generations has been pretty cheap for a while, I've seen it for 15 bucks for weeks now :P
[11/22/2012 11:24:39 AM] Cjn14: Poor SANIC
[11/22/2012 11:24:49 AM] Christopher Kimble: gotta float fast
[11/22/2012 11:24:51 AM] Alaris: Oh, damn.
[11/22/2012 11:25:01 AM] Christopher Kimble: Usually the PS3 version
[11/22/2012 11:25:33 AM] Cjn14: Gah, I'd like a PS3 so badly.
[11/22/2012 11:25:38 AM] Cjn14: So many good fighting games
[11/22/2012 11:25:40 AM] Cjn14: SO MANY.
[11/22/2012 11:25:52 AM] Christopher Kimble: I love my PS3
[11/22/2012 11:25:57 AM] invader.mle: me too
[11/22/2012 11:26:23 AM] Hunter: well, i love my dreamcast
[11/22/2012 11:26:26 AM] invader.mle: there's a new ps3 that came out recently with 500 gigs
[11/22/2012 11:26:38 AM] Cjn14: Speaking of which... I think SkullGirls for PC was supposed to be out by now... I really should learn that fightan...
[11/22/2012 11:26:50 AM] Alaris: >.< Had a chance to get a PS3 for $90.  But I had NOTHING at the time, could not get it
[11/22/2012 11:26:57 AM] Cjn14: Oh god Alaris
[11/22/2012 11:27:00 AM] Christopher Kimble: I saw that, it was that slimmer one or whatever, that would be insane
[11/22/2012 11:27:11 AM] Christopher Kimble: and dude, that's agonizing
[11/22/2012 11:27:25 AM] Alaris: >.< No kidding.
[11/22/2012 11:27:27 AM] Alaris: It was terrible
[11/22/2012 11:27:36 AM] Alaris: Went back when I did have the money, and it had long since sold.
[11/22/2012 11:27:42 AM] Alaris: I mean, it was refurbished, but I wouldn't have minded.
[11/22/2012 11:27:44 AM] invader.mle: it's slimmer and the top opens so that you don't have the danger of getting your game stuck in the system
[11/22/2012 11:28:10 AM] Christopher Kimble: People I've seen are pretty mixed on it, I dunno, if I get a slim anything it'd be a 360
[11/22/2012 11:28:18 AM] Christopher Kimble: but I don't think the hard drives are replacable? I dunno
[11/22/2012 11:28:26 AM] Cjn14: Hey, Garry's Mod is on sale.
[11/22/2012 11:28:29 AM] Christopher Kimble: and refurbished is better than none assuming it works
[11/22/2012 11:28:34 AM] Cjn14: I barely have enough money to get it.
[11/22/2012 11:28:35 AM] Christopher Kimble: and really? How much?
[11/22/2012 11:28:38 AM] Cjn14: 2.50
[11/22/2012 11:28:40 AM] invader.mle: I'd like to think with that many gigs you don't need to replace the hard drive
[11/22/2012 11:28:47 AM] Christopher Kimble: What's your Steam name? I'll get it for both of us
[11/22/2012 11:28:56 AM] Christopher Kimble: on the 360? not sure what the sizes are on those
[11/22/2012 11:29:06 AM] Alaris: Lol.
[11/22/2012 11:29:06 AM] Christopher Kimble: For that 500 GB PS3 though yeah haha you'd have to really try
[11/22/2012 11:29:12 AM] Cjn14: Oh, thank you, but no thanks
[11/22/2012 11:29:15 AM] invader.mle: oh I thought you meant ps3
[11/22/2012 11:29:20 AM] Christopher Kimble: Sorry xD
[11/22/2012 11:29:31 AM] Christopher Kimble: You sure? I don't mind
[11/22/2012 11:29:37 AM] Hunter: more marching bands
[11/22/2012 11:29:47 AM] Alaris: 360 hard drives are replacable.  Thoguh they have weird lisencing issues with it.
[11/22/2012 11:30:01 AM] Cjn14: Nah, never really been interested, just that I was looking for games that I can purchase with my leftover $2.53
[11/22/2012 11:30:03 AM] Alaris: PS3s are internal though.
[11/22/2012 11:30:21 AM] Alaris: At least I think they are.
[11/22/2012 11:30:23 AM] Alaris: I don't own one.
[11/22/2012 11:30:24 AM] Christopher Kimble: Huh, I thought I remembered that you couldn't slap an old hard drive onto a new one but maybe I was mixed up. and yeah, you have to riskly open your PS3 if you wanna/gotta replace that
[11/22/2012 11:30:49 AM] Cjn14: That's what I've heard from a friend, actually.
[11/22/2012 11:30:53 AM] Christopher Kimble: I dunno, consoles play games, that's all i can say for sure :v
[11/22/2012 11:31:07 AM] invader.mle: I think it depends on which ps3 you have, because with some you would ruin the whole thing if you opened it
[11/22/2012 11:31:08 AM] Cjn14: Wait...Wait...
[11/22/2012 11:31:12 AM] Cjn14: Consoles play games?
[11/22/2012 11:31:15 AM] Alaris: O.O
[11/22/2012 11:31:15 AM] Alaris: WHAT?!
[11/22/2012 11:31:23 AM] invader.mle: UNHEARD OF
