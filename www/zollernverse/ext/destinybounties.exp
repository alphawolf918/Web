%CONTENT%=&nbsp;Below is a list of helpful tips for you to complete Destiny bounties easier and faster. :)<br><br><strong>&nbsp; <font size="4">» Kill 20 or more enemies with your super</font></strong><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> There is a location on Earth in The Steppes (which is the spawn area) <br><br>in which 6 - 7 Fallen will spawn. If you run into that building (the <br><br>largest one right in the center), and go down the stairs, there will be <br><br>two rooms. One behind you will be a dead-end where a loot chest will <br><br>sometimes spawn. Another one in front of you will require you to go <br><br>down-stairs again. Once downstairs, stand in the left-hand corner at the<br><br> bottom of the stairs, against the wall. Once you see your radar light <br><br>up red in the top-right-hand-corner, they have spawned. Kill them using <br><br>your conventional weapons until your Super charges, and then <strong>FOW!</strong><br><br> Dead! Depending on what Super you used, you should generate anywhere <br><br>from 6 - 8 orbs of light (sometimes more for Warlocks and rarely <br><br>Hunters).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>NOTE:</strong> Hunters doing this class should <br><br>consider using the Gunslinger sub-class as this makes it go much faster <br><br>with the help of friends, using each others' orbs of light to charge - <br><br>Bladedancer generates 1 (or 2, if you're lucky) every other kill. <br><br>Warlocks should use the Voidwalker class when doing this bounty, as <br><br>kills while under Radiance in the Sunslinger class don't seem to count. <br><br>Titans should, quite obviously, use their Striker class as Defender does<br><br> not have an offensive mode.<br>
