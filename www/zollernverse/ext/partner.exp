%CONTENT%=Looking to partner with us? Great! We don't wanna seem overly excited, but...ERMAHGERD. At this point, we would be willing to affiliate/partner with anyone who is willing. When I say "affiliate", by the way, I mean site-to-site linking. We link to you, you link to us, y'know. Details can be worked out through messaging or through e-mail, doesn't matter to me, either way works fine. If you'd like to e-mail me, send it to <a href="mailto:admin@zollernverse.org">admin@zollernverse.org</a> and we'll talk!<br><br>The only real requirements (for now) are that the site be a gaming and/or techie web site. It wouldn't make too much sense to link to sites that have no relation to one another. Other than that, pretty much anyone is welcome. Oh, and the site needs to be at most PG-13 and not endorse anything illegal. Just tryin' to keep a clean slate, y'know? That and staying out of jail. We wouldn't survive in jail. Anyway, I hope to hear from you! <strong>Soon I'll add an affiliation form so it becomes easier for everyone</strong>, but for now I think I'm just gonna leave it like this and hope for the best. :)<br>
