--Planet Randomizer--
-[Project Idea]-
[Uses procedural generation to create a database of a galaxy]
---------------------

[Functions by running a loop from 1 to 10, up to 18 times]

-List of names to choose from (beginning, first middle, second middle, end), with the first and second middles being optional
	-Every single name can only be used once
	-Stars will have 3 syllables at most
		-Planets will have up to 4
-For every solar system generated:
	-if it has planets
	-how many planets if the above is true
	-distance from the galactic center (37,925,487,807 miles to 621,371,192,237,333,890 miles)
	-size (from 1,989,100 * 10^5 kg to 509,209,600 * 10^5 kg)
	-temp (5,778 K to 40,000 K)
	-For every planet generated:
		-if it has moons
		-how many moons if the above is true
		-temperature (From -380 to 801 F)
		-distance from its star (92,950,000 miles to 3,600,000,000 miles)
		-size (1.30900 Ã— 10^22 kg to )
		-atmospheric gasses (nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, neo, helium, methane)
		-is habitable
		-star_id
		-For every moon generated:
			-scale factor (how much the temperature of the moon is multiplied or divided, ranging from 2 to 8)
			-temperature (%planetTemp% / 4 F to %planetTemp% * 4F)
			-distance of moons from planet (238,855 miles to 10,986 miles)
			-atmospheric gasses
			-is habitable
			-planet_id
